       "'Text: \\n1. Christian Thomasius\\n1.1 Life and Works\\n\\nChristian Thomasius was born on 1 January 1655 in Leipzig. He was the\\nson of Jakob Thomasius (1622–84), a well-known jurist and\\nphilosopher at the University of Leipzig who counted Leibniz among his\\nstudents. Christian (hereafter simply ‘Thomasius’)\\nmatriculated in the philosophy faculty at Leipzig in 1669, and was\\npromoted to Magister artium in 1672. As a result of his\\nfather’s lectures, particularly on Hugo Grotius’ De\\njure belli ac pacis, and his interest in Samuel Pufendorf’s\\nDe jure naturae et gentium, Thomasius took up the study of\\nlaw in Frankfurt an der Oder in 1675 and was awarded a doctorate in\\n1679. After a brief journey to Holland, Thomasius returned to Leipzig\\nwhere he worked (unhappily) as a lawyer while also holding private\\nlectures on natural jurisprudence. Thomasius attests to the\\nfundamental reorientation of his thinking effected by his reading of\\nPufendorf, and the Apologia pro se et suo libro (1674) in\\nparticular, which he credits for convincing him of the independence of\\nnatural law from theology as well as of the need to question authority\\nand resist religious intolerance (Thomasius 1688a, “Diss.\\nProem.” §§5–10; Hochstrasser 2000:\\n113–121). This new anti-authoritarian cast of mind is clearly\\nevident in a dissertation on bigamy of 1685, in which Thomasius\\ndefends the practice as consistent with natural law, and which\\nunsurprisingly led to a confrontation with a professor in the theology\\nfaculty at Leipzig. Thomasius’ pioneering decision to hold\\nlectures in German, announced (in German) in 1687, likewise provoked\\ncontroversy, as did his publication beginning in 1688 of a monthly\\njournal (the first periodical published in German), entitled the\\nMonatsgespräche, in which Thomasius commented,\\nfrequently satirically, on the local intellectual scene.\\nThomasius’ lectures and publications increasingly generated\\nconflict with the theological faculty in Leipzig, which upheld a\\nrather strict form of Lutheran orthodoxy, and while his connections\\nwith the Saxon court stood him in good stead for a time, his defence\\nof an inter-faith marriage involving a (Lutheran) Saxon count and a\\n(Calvinist) Brandenburg princess cost him his protection, and in March\\n1690 he was prohibited from publishing and holding lectures (private\\nand academic) in Electoral Saxony.'"

Socrates does seem to take his\\nconclusion to imply, or at least strongly suggest, that it is natural\\nfor the soul either “to be altogether indissoluble, or nearly\\nso”, but, in any case, that the soul is less subject to\\ndissolution and destruction than the body, rather than, as the popular\\nview has it, more so. If this position can be established, Socrates is\\nin a position to refute the popular view that the soul, being composed\\nof ethereal stuff, is more liable to dispersion and destruction\\nthan the body.  However, as Cebes points out (88b), unless Socrates\\ncan establish that the soul is altogether exempt from destruction,\\nconfidence of survival in the face of death is misplaced. Socrates'\\nsoul may be a great deal more durable than his body, but as long as it\\nis not truly imperishable, there can be no guarantee that it will\\nsurvive Socrates' impending death. For it might have experienced any\\nnumber of incarnations already, and the current one might be its\\nlast.

       " Document(page_content='Seneca manages to defend clemency’s claim to the rank of virtue\\nby distinguishing it both from its opposite, crudelitas or\\ncruelty, and from a related disposition, misericordia, pity\\nor compassion, which for the Stoics counted as a vice (2.4.4). The\\nStoic sage will exercise clemency by attending to the circumstances\\nand causes of the criminal’s act, but also by seeking in various\\nways to improve the latter’s character (1.14.1–3,\\n1.16.1–3), an approach that goes back at least to Plato\\n(Prt. 324a–c, Grg.469a–b), doing so with\\nparsimony and discernment between those who are curable and those who\\nare not (again with Plato, Grg.525a–526b). Indeed,\\nSeneca asserts that those who are curable will generally strive\\nsubsequently to become worthy of the clemency shown to them by the\\nprince (2.2.1), a principle illustrated by the story of\\nAugustus’ clemency toward the conspirator Cnaeus Cornelius\\nCinna, who would become his lifelong friend (1.9). In good Stoic\\nfashion, Seneca finally shows that the virtue of clemency is both\\nvaluable in itself and also beneficial. It sustains the rule of a\\nprince by inspiring love in his subjects (1.19.6), whereas cruelty\\naugments the number of his enemies (1.8.7). And conversely, whereas\\nmisericordia wallows in a wrongful and inefficient emotional\\npity for the treatment that justice would prescribe of the criminal\\n(2.6.1), clemency improves the criminal more efficiently than cruelty\\nwould do (1.22.1), and for this and other reasons better aims at the\\ngood of mankind. It is worth noting finally that, while Seneca\\nspecifies that clemency should also extend to slaves, his\\ncosmopolitanism stopped short of advocating their manumission or the\\nabolition of slavery (Griffin 1992:\\n 256–85).[15]\\n\\nSeneca did not limit himself to the political function of advising\\nrulers. Instead, he conceived the role of philosophy as benefiting\\npeople generally, in the widest sense of a cosmopolitan ethics and\\neven politics. His De otio (“On Leisure”)\\ncontrasts the single commonwealth embracing gods and men in a cosmic\\ncitizenship, with the ordinary multiple commonwealths to which the\\naccidents of birth assign us (though these also rightly command\\nallegiance) (4.1). Should such an ordinary regime turn lethal, the\\nphilosopher remains a citizen of the cosmic commonwealth, and so his\\nserenity can and should remain intact. That fate befell Seneca himself\\nin 65 CE, when Nero accused him of conspiring in a planned\\nassassination of the emperor and ordered him to commit suicide. To be\\nsure, however, Seneca’s suicide reflected not only political\\nobedience, but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, the belief,\\npreviously expressed in his writings (in particular De\\nprovidentia and De ira, as well as his letters) that\\nsuicide is a supreme mark of freedom.

       "[{'text': 'In most cultures, there is evidence of a belief in some sort of\\npersonal afterlife, in which the same individual that lived and died\\nnevertheless persists and continues to have new experiences. There are\\nalternatives, however. The ancient Greeks are noted for having placed\\na high premium on “survival” in the memory and honor of\\nthe community—a practice reflected in our reference to deceased\\ncelebrities as (for example) “the immortal Babe Ruth”.\\n(Strictly speaking, this for the Greeks was not a replacement for a\\npersonal afterlife, but rather a supplement to what was conceived as a\\nrather colorless and unrewarding existence in Hades.) Such a hope, it\\nwould seem, provides a major consolation only if one is optimistic\\nconcerning the persistence and continued memory of the community, as\\nwell as the accuracy and justice of their judgments. An interesting\\nvariant of this form of immorality is found in process theology, with\\nits promise of “objective immortality” in the mind of God,\\nwho neither forgets nor misjudges the lives he remembers (Hartshorne\\n1962: 262). Hindu and Buddhist traditions include a belief in\\nreincarnation. Hindu philosophical tradition gives more credence to\\nthe enduring of individuals through successive rebirths and deaths\\nthan does Buddhist philosophical tradition see Knine 2010). In\\nBuddhist philosophy, the ongoing task is to produce a sufficient\\nconsciousness of the self for there to be reincarnation, while\\nsimultaneously securing the understanding that the individual self is\\nnot (in the end) a substantial, concrete thing, but a delusion that\\nwill dissolve or become liberated into Nirvana (see Nattier 2010).\\n\\n\\nOther entries in this encyclopedia address themes in Hindu and\\nBuddhist philosophy (see, e.g., the entry on\\nmind in Indian Buddhist philosophy),\\nso we will forego a comparative study here of\\ncompeting religious portraits of an afterlife. For two immensely\\nvaluable resources for reflection on the afterlife from diverse\\nreligious and philosophical perspectives, see The Palgrave Handbook of\\nthe Afterlife (Nagasawa & Matheson eds. 2017) and The\\nOxford Handbook to the Eschaton (Walls ed. 2010). A fascinating\\nsynthesis of different religious portraits of an afterlife is\\ndeveloped in Hick 1976. We also note, but do\\nnot comment on, an important topic in Christian philosophical theology\\nconcerning universalism, the belief that, eventually, all persons will\\nbe saved (see Parry and Partridge 2003).\\n\\nOur focus for much of the rest of this\\nentry is on the possibility and the reasonability of believing there\\nis an afterlife for individual persons, though we will offer some\\nobservations along the way about the kinds of afterlife that are\\npossible, given different metaphysical assumptions. As for the\\nphilosophers like Kierkegaard and Becker, cited earlier, who castigate\\nthose of us who ignore our mortality, we suggest that sometimes the\\ncontemplation of mortality can be disabling and distract us from\\nseeking immediate goods (such as those Dworkin highlights) or\\nrelieving suffering. It would not be admirable for the aid workers in\\nSinger’s example to pause in their work in order to hold\\ndeath-and-dying seminars. However, while there might be nothing wrong\\nin living without wrestling with mortality, there are sufficient good\\nreasons why the topics of the nature of death and the existence (or\\nnon-existence) of an afterlife are philosophically interesting and\\ndeserving of attention.',\n",

       " Document(page_content='Wielenberg’s comments on the Holocaust are puzzling. Of course,\\nno one except a murderous, psychopathic Nazi would hope the Holocaust\\nlasted longer or that it involved the death of even one more\\nindividual. But what one hopes will take place a million years from\\nnow is not irrelevant ethically or in terms of values. Consider two\\nfutures: in one, the Jews survive a million years from now and are\\nthriving. In another, imagine that a million years from now there is a\\nrevival of the Nazi party. The Jews have colonized Mars and Nazi\\ngenocidal units are dispatched to treat Jewish settlements the way the\\nNazis treated the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940. This time, the Nazis succeed\\nin annihilating every last Jew. Surely, it would be deeply perverse to\\nhope for the second future. It would also be perverse to be\\nindifferent now about whether the second will occur. We cannot imagine\\nthat a person of integrity would say they are utterly indifferent\\nabout whether all Jews will be annihilated by Nazis in the future, be\\nit a million years, ten million, twenty, or….\\n\\nNagel’s comment (cited by Wielenberg) is worthy of note. His\\ncomment suggests that what we do now will (or may) not matter a\\nmillion years from now, but there is an important distinction between\\nwhether some event matters (in the sense that it is valuable; it is\\ngood that the event occurred) and whether persons who live in the\\nfuture are aware of the event and care about it. Arguably, it will\\nalways be the case that the Holocaust should not have happened,\\nregardless of whether any human being remembers it a hundred (or a\\nthousand or a million) years from now. Moreover, those of us who are\\nhorrified about this genocide should hope that remembering it and\\npassing on a record of it has no statute of limitation. In keeping\\nwith our earlier thought experiment, imagine two futures: a million\\nyears from now, persons recall the Holocaust and continue to lament\\nthis mass genocide; in a different future imagine persons are all\\nNazis and they only recall the Holocaust as a failure to succeed in\\nkilling all Jews, something they were only able to achieve in the year\\n1,002,014.\\n\\nSo, one reason why the topic of an afterlife is of historical and\\ncontemporary interest is because our values about present persons,\\nthings, and events have a bearing on the future, including the\\npossibility of a future for individuals after their death. If we know\\nthat it is impossible for individual persons to survive biological\\ndeath, speculation on an afterlife we might expect or hope for would\\nbe pointless (unless it serves some purpose in terms of fiction), but\\nit would not be pointless to reflect on whether the impossibility of\\nan afterlife should dominate our values in this life. What are the\\nimplications for our lives now if we take seriously the idea that at\\ndeath we will pass into oblivion? Some philosophers adopt a strategy\\nlike Singer’s and Wielenberg’s about our individual lives.\\nIn Religion Without God Ronald Dworkin is candid about\\n“what we desperately dread”, namely “the total,\\nobliterating, itself unimaginable, snuffing out of everything”\\n(2013: 150).

      "page_content=\"It is probably true that in mainstream fifth century Greek culture,\\nbelief in an afterlife of the soul was weak and unclear (Claus 1981,\\n68; Burnet 1916, 248-9).

(In fact, in the\\nApology, 40c, Socrates himself is presented as being\\nnoncommittal about what happens to the soul at death, and even about\\nwhether it survives at all.) “Men find it very hard to\\nbelieve”, Cebes says at Phaedo 70a, “what you said\\nabout the soul. They think that after it has left the body it no\\nlonger exists anywhere, but that it is destroyed and dissolved on the\\nday the man dies.” This view is restated by Simmias (at 77b) as\\nthe opinion of the majority (cf. 80d); note that the view includes the\\nidea that the soul is a material thing, and is destroyed by being\\ndispersed, “like breath or smoke” (70a). Glaucon, in the\\nlast book of the Republic (608d), is taken aback by\\nSocrates' question,\\n\\n\\n“Haven't you realized that our soul is immortal and never\\ndestroyed?”\\n\\nHe looked at me with wonder and said: “No, by god, I\\nhaven't.

      "page_content='Wielenberg’s comments on the Holocaust are puzzling. Of course,\\nno one except a murderous, psychopathic Nazi would hope the Holocaust\\nlasted longer or that it involved the death of even one more\\nindividual. But what one hopes will take place a million years from\\nnow is not irrelevant ethically or in terms of values. Consider two\\nfutures: in one, the Jews survive a million years from now and are\\nthriving. In another, imagine that a million years from now there is a\\nrevival of the Nazi party. The Jews have colonized Mars and Nazi\\ngenocidal units are dispatched to treat Jewish settlements the way the\\nNazis treated the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940. This time, the Nazis succeed\\nin annihilating every last Jew. Surely, it would be deeply perverse to\\nhope for the second future. It would also be perverse to be\\nindifferent now about whether the second will occur. We cannot imagine\\nthat a person of integrity would say they are utterly indifferent\\nabout whether all Jews will be annihilated by Nazis in the future, be\\nit a million years, ten million, twenty, or….\\n\\nNagel’s comment (cited by Wielenberg) is worthy of note. His\\ncomment suggests that what we do now will (or may) not matter a\\nmillion years from now, but there is an important distinction between\\nwhether some event matters (in the sense that it is valuable; it is\\ngood that the event occurred) and whether persons who live in the\\nfuture are aware of the event and care about it. Arguably, it will\\nalways be the case that the Holocaust should not have happened,\\nregardless of whether any human being remembers it a hundred (or a\\nthousand or a million) years from now. Moreover, those of us who are\\nhorrified about this genocide should hope that remembering it and\\npassing on a record of it has no statute of limitation. In keeping\\nwith our earlier thought experiment, imagine two futures: a million\\nyears from now, persons recall the Holocaust and continue to lament\\nthis mass genocide; in a different future imagine persons are all\\nNazis and they only recall the Holocaust as a failure to succeed in\\nkilling all Jews, something they were only able to achieve in the year\\n1,002,014.\\n\\nSo, one reason why the topic of an afterlife is of historical and\\ncontemporary interest is because our values about present persons,\\nthings, and events have a bearing on the future, including the\\npossibility of a future for individuals after their death. If we know\\nthat it is impossible for individual persons to survive biological\\ndeath, speculation on an afterlife we might expect or hope for would\\nbe pointless (unless it serves some purpose in terms of fiction), but\\nit would not be pointless to reflect on whether the impossibility of\\nan afterlife should dominate our values in this life. What are the\\nimplications for our lives now if we take seriously the idea that at\\ndeath we will pass into oblivion? Some philosophers adopt a strategy\\nlike Singer’s and Wielenberg’s about our individual lives.\\nIn Religion Without God Ronald Dworkin is candid about\\n“what we desperately dread”, namely “the total,\\nobliterating, itself unimaginable, snuffing out of everything”\\n(2013: 150). While he thinks some kind of individual afterlife may be\\npossible (even given atheistic naturalism) he does propose a\\n“kind of immortality” which is “the only kind we\\nhave any business wanting” (Dworkin 2013: 159).' metadata={'article_id': '34', 'authors': ['William Hasker --- No email provided', 'Charles Taliaferro --- taliafer@stolaf.edu'], 'chunk': 2.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=afterlife', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/afterlife/', 'title': 'Afterlife'}\n"

There are\\nalternatives, however. The ancient Greeks are noted for having placed\\na high premium on “survival” in the memory and honor of\\nthe community—a practice reflected in our reference to deceased\\ncelebrities as (for example) “the immortal Babe Ruth”.\\n(Strictly speaking, this for the Greeks was not a replacement for a\\npersonal afterlife, but rather a supplement to what was conceived as a\\nrather colorless and unrewarding existence in Hades.) Such a hope, it\\nwould seem, provides a major consolation only if one is optimistic\\nconcerning the persistence and continued memory of the community, as\\nwell as the accuracy and justice of their judgments. An interesting\\nvariant of this form of immorality is found in process theology, with\\nits promise of “objective immortality” in the mind of God,\\nwho neither forgets nor misjudges the lives he remembers (Hartshorne\\n1962: 262). Hindu and Buddhist traditions include a belief in\\nreincarnation. Hindu philosophical tradition gives more credence to\\nthe enduring of individuals through successive rebirths and deaths\\nthan does Buddhist philosophical tradition see Knine 2010). In\\nBuddhist philosophy, the ongoing task is to produce a sufficient\\nconsciousness of the self for there to be reincarnation, while\\nsimultaneously securing the understanding that the individual self is\\nnot (in the end) a substantial, concrete thing, but a delusion that\\nwill dissolve or become liberated into Nirvana (see Nattier 2010).\\n\\n\\nOther entries in this encyclopedia address themes in Hindu and\\nBuddhist philosophy (see, e.g., the entry on\\nmind in Indian Buddhist philosophy),\\nso we will forego a comparative study here of\\ncompeting religious portraits of an afterlife. For two immensely\\nvaluable resources for reflection on the afterlife from diverse\\nreligious and philosophical perspectives, see The Palgrave Handbook of\\nthe Afterlife (Nagasawa & Matheson eds. 2017) and The\\nOxford Handbook to the Eschaton (Walls ed. 2010). A fascinating\\nsynthesis of different religious portraits of an afterlife is\\ndeveloped in Hick 1976. We also note, but do\\nnot comment on, an important topic in Christian philosophical theology\\nconcerning universalism, the belief that, eventually, all persons will\\nbe saved (see Parry and Partridge 2003).\\n\\nOur focus for much of the rest of this\\nentry is on the possibility and the reasonability of believing there\\nis an afterlife for individual persons, though we will offer some\\nobservations along the way about the kinds of afterlife that are\\npossible, given different metaphysical assumptions.
