They think that after it has left the body it no\\nlonger exists anywhere, but that it is destroyed and dissolved on the\\nday the man dies.” This view is restated by Simmias (at 77b) as\\nthe opinion of the majority (cf. 80d); note that the view includes the\\nidea that the soul is a material thing, and is destroyed by being\\ndispersed, “like breath or smoke” (70a).

Answering both\\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\\ntime of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of\\nargument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the\\nimmortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls\\nenjoy lives of thought and intelligence.

It\\nwill suffice to comment selectively on aspects of the arguments that\\nbear directly on Plato's conception of the soul. The argument that\\nsheds most light on what Plato takes the nature of the soul to be is\\nthe affinity argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the\\nwidespread worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed\\nby being dispersed.  It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of\\nthings: on the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of\\nparts, and subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand,\\nthings that are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by\\nthought), not composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and\\ndestruction. These two categories are obviously mutually exclusive. It\\nis not clear whether or not they are meant to be exhaustive.\\nMoreover, the category of imperishable, intelligible being is\\nexemplified, but not, it seems, exhausted, by Platonic forms such as\\nequality, beauty and the like (contra Bostock 1986, 118).\\nIntelligible being evidently includes what Socrates calls the divine,\\nwhose nature it is to rule and to lead (80a), and there is no\\nindication that the forms exhaust the divine, or even include the\\ndivine, so understood.  Thus the argument leaves room for the idea\\nthat souls are not forms, but are nevertheless intelligible, partless\\nand imperishable (contra Robinson 1995, 29). In fact, in\\nframing the argument in the way he does Plato furnishes the conceptual\\nframework needed for saying that body and soul differ in kind, the one\\nbeing perceptible and perishable, the other being intelligible and\\nexempt from destruction.

Before that moment, Plato imagines Socrates\\nbeing visited in prison by his friend Crito (in a dialogue which bears\\nthe latter’s name), and urged to escape for the sake of his\\nfriends and family, a practice which was frequently tolerated in\\nAthens so long as the escapee fled into exile. Socrates is not\\npersuaded by Crito’s arguments. He begins his examination of\\nthem by recalling principles to which he and Crito had in the past\\nagreed, including the principle that it is better to suffer injustice\\nthan to commit it (Cri. 47a–50a). He then goes on to\\nventriloquize a series of speeches against escape, which he ascribes\\nto the “Laws of\\n Athens”.[6]\\n These speeches articulate a set of special connections between\\nSocrates and the Laws of Athens which, depending on one’s\\nreading, either flesh out the principle that it is better to suffer\\ninjustice than to do it (by dramatizing reasons for which it would\\nunjust for Socrates to escape), or else stand in tension with it by\\ninvoking absolutist grounds with implications more extensive than such\\na principle would authorize (Harte 1999). On any reading, it is\\nimportant to bear in mind that Socrates is choosing to obey a jury\\nverdict that has commanded him to suffer what is arguably an\\ninjustice, but not to commit one, so that one of his fundamental\\nethical principles here as elsewhere in Plato (that it is better to\\nsuffer an injustice than to commit one) is at least compatible with\\nhis acceptance of the jury’s sentence.\\n\\nThe “Laws of Athens” appeal to a kind of social contract\\nmade between themselves and Socrates. The contract is unequal: the\\n“Laws” compare themselves to parents and slaveowners, and\\nSocrates to child and slave.

He went so far as to claim that as a civic\\nbenefactor, he deserved not death but the lifelong publicly provided\\nmeals commonly awarded to an Olympic champion (36e–37a).\\nSocrates here depicts himself as a new kind of citizen,\\nconceptualizing the public good in a new way and so serving it best\\nthrough unprecedented actions, in contrast to the conventionally\\ndefined paths of political contest and success (Villa 2001).\\n\\nWhile depicting himself in his defense speeches in Plato’s\\nApology as a new kind of virtuous citizen, Socrates makes\\nthree remarks which have in modern times been seized upon as\\nindications of the principled limits which he might have put on the\\nrequirement to obey the law. The first two recalled political\\nincidents: while serving on the Council, he had voted against an\\nillegal proposal (32b–c); and under the brief oligarchical\\ndomination of “The Thirty”, he had disobeyed an order of\\nthe ruling body to arrest a democratic partisan for execution\\n(32c–d).

That elevation of\\nknowledge in turn led Socrates to militate against the practices of\\nrhetoric and judgment which animated political institutions of Athens\\nsuch as the law-courts, Assembly and Council.

       " Document(page_content=\"Coming from the theories of Plato and Aristotle, the first thing that\\nmight strike us about the theories of soul adopted by the two dominant\\nHellenistic schools, Epicurus' Garden and the Stoa, is the doctrine,\\nshared by both, that the soul is corporeal. A number of Stoic\\narguments for the claim that the soul is a body have come down to us\\n(see Annas 1992, 39-41). The best one of these is that the soul is a\\nbody because (roughly) only bodies affect one another, and soul and\\nbody do affect one another, for instance in cases of bodily damage and\\nemotion. Epicurus employs the same argument in his Letter to\\nHerodotus, which provides an outline of his physical doctrines\\n(Long & Sedley 1987 [in what follows L&S] 14A7). In a way that\\nreminds one of Presocratic theories, both Epicurus and the Stoics hold\\nthat the soul is a particularly fine kind of body, diffused all the\\nway through the perceptible (flesh-and-blood) body of the animate\\norganism. As if echoing the view of the soul that Simmias in the\\nPhaedo presents as the majority view, Epicurus thinks that the\\nsoul is dispersed at death along with its constituent atoms, losing\\nthe powers that it has while it is contained by the body of the\\norganism that it ensouls (L&S 14A6). The Stoics agree that the\\nhuman soul is mortal, but they also take it that it can and does\\nsurvive the person's death — that is, its separation from the\\nperceptible body. Chrysippus apparently thought that the souls of wise\\npersons persist (as fine, imperceptible corporeal structures) all the\\nway to the next conflagration in the cosmic cycle, whereas the souls\\nof other people last for some time, and then get dispersed (Diogenes\\nLaertius 7.157; cf. L&S 53W). Thus Chrysippus can accept, at least\\nfor the souls of the wise, Socrates' claim in the Phaedo that\\nthe soul is “altogether indissoluble, or nearly so”\\n(Phaedo 80b), even though he plainly cannot accept all of\\nSocrates' argument for this claim. \\n5.1 Epicurus' Theory of Soul\", metadata={'article_id': '76', 'authors': ['Hendrik Lorenz --- hlorenz@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 26.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-soul', 'date': '2009', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-soul/', 'title': 'Ancient Theories of Soul'}),\n",

He may have been the first\\nthinker to articulate a connection between soul and motor\\nfunctions. “A man when he is drunk”, Heraclitus remarks,\\n“is led by an unfledged boy, stumbling and not knowing where he\\ngoes, having his soul moist” (fr. 117, KR&S 231). On the\\nmost plausible construal of Heraclitus' sentence, he is saying that\\nthe drunken person stumbles because his perceptual abilities have been\\nimpaired, and this impairment is due to moistness of soul (Schofield\\n1991, 22). Like many (or indeed all) sixth and fifth century thinkers\\nwho expressed views on the nature or constitution of the soul,\\nHeraclitus thought that the soul was bodily, but composed of an\\nunusually fine or rare kind of matter, e.g. air or fire.

But for his student Plato and\\nPlato’s student Aristotle, the practice and even the study of\\nhuman affairs such as politics were less divine, and so less\\nadmirable, than the broader study of truth about the natural and the\\ndivine realms. Philosophy might have to address the political but its\\nhighest calling soared above it. If Socrates’ political fate was\\npart of the stimulus for Plato to invent a new metaphysics and\\nepistemology in order to articulate an alternative realm of political\\npossibility, Plato’s dialogues show Socrates simultaneously\\nasserting an independence for those disciplines from the bonds of the\\npolitical\\n alone.[5]\\n\\nThis distinctive Greek—and particularly Platonic – outlook\\nmust condition any historical understanding of the development of\\nancient political philosophy. While one influential approach to the\\nhistory of political thought takes its bearings from what a thinker\\nwas trying to do in and by what he or she said or wrote, it is\\nimportant to recognize that the founders of ancient political\\nphilosophy were in part trying to define a new space of doing as\\nphilosophizing, independent of ordinary political action. This is not\\nto say that they did not also have ordinary political intentions, but\\nrather to stress that the invention of political philosophy was also\\nintended as a mode of reflection upon the value of ordinary political\\nlife.\\n3. Socrates and Plato\\n\\nAccording to Cicero, Socrates (469–399 BCE) was the first to\\nbring philosophy down from heaven, locating it in cities and even in\\npeople’s kitchens (Tusc.V.10). A humbly born man who\\nrefused the lucrative mantle of the sophistic professional teacher,\\nyet attracted many of the most ambitious and aristocratic youth of\\nAthens to accompany him in his questioning of them and their elders as\\nto the nature of the virtues they claimed to possess or understand, he\\nleft no philosophical writings. We know him only through the surviving\\ntestimony of others, first the lampoons in Aristophanes’ comic\\nplays, and above all the “Socratic” dialogues written by\\nhis student Plato and his associate Xenophon (dialogues by others are\\nknown only by titles or fragments), and the remarks of Plato’s\\nstudent Aristotle, as well as other sources from after or even long\\nafter his death (for a collection, see Giannantoni 1990, and see the\\nentry on\\n Socrates).\\n3.1 Socratic Ethics and Politics', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 5.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'})]"

Answering both\\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\\ntime of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of\\nargument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the\\nimmortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls\\nenjoy lives of thought and intelligence. The arguments have been\\ndiscussed in some detail, for instance in Bostock 1986, and for our\\npurposes there is no need to state and analyze them systematically. It\\nwill suffice to comment selectively on aspects of the arguments that\\nbear directly on Plato's conception of the soul. The argument that\\nsheds most light on what Plato takes the nature of the soul to be is\\nthe affinity argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the\\nwidespread worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed\\nby being dispersed.  It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of\\nthings: on the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of\\nparts, and subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand,\\nthings that are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by\\nthought), not composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and\\ndestruction. These two categories are obviously mutually exclusive. It\\nis not clear whether or not they are meant to be exhaustive.\\nMoreover, the category of imperishable, intelligible being is\\nexemplified, but not, it seems, exhausted, by Platonic forms such as\\nequality, beauty and the like (contra Bostock 1986, 118).\\nIntelligible being evidently includes what Socrates calls the divine,\\nwhose nature it is to rule and to lead (80a), and there is no\\nindication that the forms exhaust the divine, or even include the\\ndivine, so understood.  Thus the argument leaves room for the idea\\nthat souls are not forms, but are nevertheless intelligible, partless\\nand imperishable (contra Robinson 1995, 29).

       " Document(page_content=\"It hardly needs pointing out, then, that the soul, as Plato conceives\\nof it in the Phaedo, is crucially characterized by cognitive\\nand intellectual features: it is something that reasons, more or less\\nwell depending on the extent to which it is disturbed or distracted by\\nthe body and the senses; something that regulates and controls the\\nbody and its desires and affections, “especially if it is a wise\\nsoul” (94b), presumably in a way that involves, and renders\\neffective, judgments about what it is best to do, and how it is best\\nto behave; and something that has, as the kind of adornment that is\\ntruly appropriate to it, virtues such as temperance, justice and\\ncourage (114e f.). However, it should be clear that the soul, as it is\\nconceived of here, is not simply the mind, as we conceive of it. It is\\nboth broader and narrower than that. It is broader in that Plato\\nevidently retains the traditional idea of soul as distinguishing the\\nanimate from the inanimate. Two of the four main lines of argument for\\nthe immortality of the soul rely not on cognitive or indeed\\nspecifically psychological features of the soul, but simply on the\\nfamiliar connection between soul and life. According to the cyclical\\nargument (70c-72d), being alive in general is preceded by, just as it\\nprecedes, being dead.  Socrates takes this to show that a creature's\\ndeath involves the continued existence of the soul in question, which\\npersists through a period of separation from body, and then returns to\\nanimate another body in a change which is the counterpart of the\\nprevious change, dying. According to the last line of argument that\\nSocrates offers in the Phaedo, the soul is immortal because it\\nhas life essentially, the way fire has heat essentially. It is plain\\nthat both of these arguments apply to the souls of all living things,\\nincluding plants (cf. 70d, 71d). And in the final argument, Socrates\\nexplicitly appeals to the idea that it is the soul that animates the\\nbody of a living thing (105c): \\n\\nWhat is it that, when present in a body, makes it living? — A\\nsoul.\", metadata={'article_id': '76', 'authors': ['Hendrik Lorenz --- hlorenz@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 13.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-soul', 'date': '2009', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-soul/', 'title': 'Ancient Theories of Soul'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='That debate has had to confront the fact that Socrates did not\\nactually disobey his own death sentence with which his trial\\nconcluded: when the time came, he drank the poisonous hemlock as\\nprescribed by the jury. Before that moment, Plato imagines Socrates\\nbeing visited in prison by his friend Crito (in a dialogue which bears\\nthe latter’s name), and urged to escape for the sake of his\\nfriends and family, a practice which was frequently tolerated in\\nAthens so long as the escapee fled into exile. Socrates is not\\npersuaded by Crito’s arguments. He begins his examination of\\nthem by recalling principles to which he and Crito had in the past\\nagreed, including the principle that it is better to suffer injustice\\nthan to commit it (Cri. 47a–50a). He then goes on to\\nventriloquize a series of speeches against escape, which he ascribes\\nto the “Laws of\\n Athens”.[6]\\n These speeches articulate a set of special connections between\\nSocrates and the Laws of Athens which, depending on one’s\\nreading, either flesh out the principle that it is better to suffer\\ninjustice than to do it (by dramatizing reasons for which it would\\nunjust for Socrates to escape), or else stand in tension with it by\\ninvoking absolutist grounds with implications more extensive than such\\na principle would authorize (Harte 1999). On any reading, it is\\nimportant to bear in mind that Socrates is choosing to obey a jury\\nverdict that has commanded him to suffer what is arguably an\\ninjustice, but not to commit one, so that one of his fundamental\\nethical principles here as elsewhere in Plato (that it is better to\\nsuffer an injustice than to commit one) is at least compatible with\\nhis acceptance of the jury’s sentence.\\n\\nThe “Laws of Athens” appeal to a kind of social contract\\nmade between themselves and Socrates. The contract is unequal: the\\n“Laws” compare themselves to parents and slaveowners, and\\nSocrates to child and slave. Obedience to them is owed, they claim,\\nbecause the “Laws” have provided the whole basis for\\nSocrates’ education and life in the city, a city in which he has\\nnotably chosen to remain, never traveling abroad except on military\\nservice. But the “Laws” also speak of the opportunity they\\nafford to Socrates to “persuade or obey” them (51b;\\n51e–52a). The meaning of this clause and its relevance to civil\\ndisobedience is again much debated (Kraut 1984 remains a landmark).\\nNevertheless, the image of Socrates tried, convicted, and made to die\\n(by his own hand) at the city’s command has come to be a vivid\\nand powerful symbol of tension in the relationship between political\\nphilosophy and political authority.\\n3.3 The Defense of Justice in the Republic', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 8.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Socrates seems to have been the first philosopher to treat\\nethics—as opposed to cosmology and physics—as a distinct\\narea of inquiry. Asserting in Plato’s Apology (38a)\\nthat “the unexamined life is not worth living,” he pressed\\nfor definitions of the virtues or excellences which were widely\\nrecognized and claimed by his fellows, but which they found difficult\\nto explain. As depicted by Plato, the search for such definitions led\\ninvariably to a concern with knowledge of how best to live, as not\\nonly one of the conventional virtues (in the form of wisdom) but also\\nas underpinning, even constituting, them all. That elevation of\\nknowledge in turn led Socrates to militate against the practices of\\nrhetoric and judgment which animated political institutions of Athens\\nsuch as the law-courts, Assembly and Council. Instead he posited the\\nexistence, or at least the possibility, of political expertise,\\nclaiming (in Plato’s Gorgias) to be the one person in\\nAthens who at least tried to pursue such a true politikê\\ntechnê, a complex notion that can be understood as meaning\\npolitics as a kind of professional expertise (Grg. 521d). The\\nnotion of political knowledge limited to one or a few experts, as\\nopposed to the embedded and networked knowledge produced and exercised\\nby the whole dêmos of Athens in their judgments and\\npolitical roles (Ober 2008), struck at the central premises of\\nAthenian democracy and those of Greek politics more generally (in\\noligarchies, wealth rather than knowledge was the relevant criterion\\nfor rule; in tyrannies, sheer power). Thus the nature of\\nSocrates’ concern with ethics led him directly into a form of\\npolitical philosophizing. The relation between politics and knowledge,\\nthe meaning of justice as a virtue, the value of the military courage\\nwhich all Greek cities prized in their citizens, all seem to have been\\ncentral topics of Socratic conversation.\\n3.2 Socrates’ Trial: The Political Philosophy of Citizenship\\n\\nThat engagement with political philosophy was dramatically intensified\\nwhen Socrates was, at the age of seventy, arraigned, tried, and\\nsentenced to death by an Athenian popular jury. In a prosecution\\nbrought by a group of his fellow citizens who claimed to be\\nshouldering that burden for the sake of the city (the usual way in\\nwhich prosecutions were brought in Athens), the charges laid were\\nagainst him were three-fold: not acknowledging the city’s gods;\\nintroducing new gods; and corrupting the young (Apol. 24b).\\nEach of these had a political dimension, given the civic control of\\ncentral religious cults mentioned earlier, and the broad political\\nimportance of educating the young to take their place in the civic\\norder. Timed a few years after the overthrow of a short-lived\\noligarchic regime (known as that of “The Thirty”) which\\nhad been led by several of Socrates’ sometime associates Critias\\nand Charmides (their oligarchic regime having been imposed after the\\nignominious Athenian defeat in the war with Sparta which had earlier\\nseen another associate of Socrates (Alcibiades) turn traitor to\\nAthens), the trial must be suspected of having served as a substitute\\nfor the prohibited political trials of the oligarchic partisans (such\\ntrials having been generally barred by an amnesty passed in 403 BCE by\\nthe restored democracy; see Cartledge 2009, Ch.7, Carawan 2013, Shear\\n2011).', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 6.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'})]"

If this position can be established, Socrates is\\nin a position to refute the popular view that the soul, being composed\\nof ethereal stuff, is more liable to dispersion and destruction\\nthan the body.

Answering both\\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\\ntime of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of\\nargument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the\\nimmortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls\\nenjoy lives of thought and intelligence. The arguments have been\\ndiscussed in some detail, for instance in Bostock 1986, and for our\\npurposes there is no need to state and analyze them systematically. It\\nwill suffice to comment selectively on aspects of the arguments that\\nbear directly on Plato's conception of the soul. The argument that\\nsheds most light on what Plato takes the nature of the soul to be is\\nthe affinity argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the\\nwidespread worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed\\nby being dispersed.  It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of\\nthings: on the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of\\nparts, and subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand,\\nthings that are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by\\nthought), not composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and\\ndestruction. These two categories are obviously mutually exclusive. It\\nis not clear whether or not they are meant to be exhaustive.\\nMoreover, the category of imperishable, intelligible being is\\nexemplified, but not, it seems, exhausted, by Platonic forms such as\\nequality, beauty and the like (contra Bostock 1986, 118).\\nIntelligible being evidently includes what Socrates calls the divine,\\nwhose nature it is to rule and to lead (80a), and there is no\\nindication that the forms exhaust the divine, or even include the\\ndivine, so understood.  Thus the argument leaves room for the idea\\nthat souls are not forms, but are nevertheless intelligible, partless\\nand imperishable (contra Robinson 1995, 29). In fact, in\\nframing the argument in the way he does Plato furnishes the conceptual\\nframework needed for saying that body and soul differ in kind, the one\\nbeing perceptible and perishable, the other being intelligible and\\nexempt from destruction.

       " Document(page_content='That debate has had to confront the fact that Socrates did not\\nactually disobey his own death sentence with which his trial\\nconcluded: when the time came, he drank the poisonous hemlock as\\nprescribed by the jury. Before that moment, Plato imagines Socrates\\nbeing visited in prison by his friend Crito (in a dialogue which bears\\nthe latter’s name), and urged to escape for the sake of his\\nfriends and family, a practice which was frequently tolerated in\\nAthens so long as the escapee fled into exile. Socrates is not\\npersuaded by Crito’s arguments. He begins his examination of\\nthem by recalling principles to which he and Crito had in the past\\nagreed, including the principle that it is better to suffer injustice\\nthan to commit it (Cri. 47a–50a). He then goes on to\\nventriloquize a series of speeches against escape, which he ascribes\\nto the “Laws of\\n Athens”.[6]\\n These speeches articulate a set of special connections between\\nSocrates and the Laws of Athens which, depending on one’s\\nreading, either flesh out the principle that it is better to suffer\\ninjustice than to do it (by dramatizing reasons for which it would\\nunjust for Socrates to escape), or else stand in tension with it by\\ninvoking absolutist grounds with implications more extensive than such\\na principle would authorize (Harte 1999). On any reading, it is\\nimportant to bear in mind that Socrates is choosing to obey a jury\\nverdict that has commanded him to suffer what is arguably an\\ninjustice, but not to commit one, so that one of his fundamental\\nethical principles here as elsewhere in Plato (that it is better to\\nsuffer an injustice than to commit one) is at least compatible with\\nhis acceptance of the jury’s sentence.\\n\\nThe “Laws of Athens” appeal to a kind of social contract\\nmade between themselves and Socrates. The contract is unequal: the\\n“Laws” compare themselves to parents and slaveowners, and\\nSocrates to child and slave. Obedience to them is owed, they claim,\\nbecause the “Laws” have provided the whole basis for\\nSocrates’ education and life in the city, a city in which he has\\nnotably chosen to remain, never traveling abroad except on military\\nservice. But the “Laws” also speak of the opportunity they\\nafford to Socrates to “persuade or obey” them (51b;\\n51e–52a). The meaning of this clause and its relevance to civil\\ndisobedience is again much debated (Kraut 1984 remains a landmark).\\nNevertheless, the image of Socrates tried, convicted, and made to die\\n(by his own hand) at the city’s command has come to be a vivid\\nand powerful symbol of tension in the relationship between political\\nphilosophy and political authority.\\n3.3 The Defense of Justice in the Republic', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 8.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"It hardly needs pointing out, then, that the soul, as Plato conceives\\nof it in the Phaedo, is crucially characterized by cognitive\\nand intellectual features: it is something that reasons, more or less\\nwell depending on the extent to which it is disturbed or distracted by\\nthe body and the senses; something that regulates and controls the\\nbody and its desires and affections, “especially if it is a wise\\nsoul” (94b), presumably in a way that involves, and renders\\neffective, judgments about what it is best to do, and how it is best\\nto behave; and something that has, as the kind of adornment that is\\ntruly appropriate to it, virtues such as temperance, justice and\\ncourage (114e f.). However, it should be clear that the soul, as it is\\nconceived of here, is not simply the mind, as we conceive of it. It is\\nboth broader and narrower than that. It is broader in that Plato\\nevidently retains the traditional idea of soul as distinguishing the\\nanimate from the inanimate. Two of the four main lines of argument for\\nthe immortality of the soul rely not on cognitive or indeed\\nspecifically psychological features of the soul, but simply on the\\nfamiliar connection between soul and life. According to the cyclical\\nargument (70c-72d), being alive in general is preceded by, just as it\\nprecedes, being dead.  Socrates takes this to show that a creature's\\ndeath involves the continued existence of the soul in question, which\\npersists through a period of separation from body, and then returns to\\nanimate another body in a change which is the counterpart of the\\nprevious change, dying. According to the last line of argument that\\nSocrates offers in the Phaedo, the soul is immortal because it\\nhas life essentially, the way fire has heat essentially. It is plain\\nthat both of these arguments apply to the souls of all living things,\\nincluding plants (cf. 70d, 71d).

       " Document(page_content='Socrates’ speeches in the court trial—literary versions of\\nwhich were produced by Plato, Xenophon, and a number of other\\nfollowers—forced him to confront directly the question of his\\nrole in an Athens defined by its democratic institutions and norms.\\nSocrates had played his part as an ordinary citizen, allowing his name\\nto go forward for selection by lot to serve on the Council, and\\nserving in the army when required. But he had not engaged actively in\\n“public affairs” (ta pragmata, Apol.\\n32e): he had not spoken in the Assembly (31c), nor, so far as we know,\\nbrought any prosecutions in the law-courts. In Plato’s account,\\nafter countering the religious accusations, Socrates acknowledged this\\nabstention from public affairs but claimed to have had a more\\nsignificant mission laid on him by the god Apollo when his oracle at\\nDelphi declared that no man was wiser than Socrates: his mission was\\nto stir up the city like a gadfly (30e), discussing virtue and related\\nmatters (38a), and benefiting each person by “trying to persuade\\nhim” to care for virtue rather than wealth for himself and for\\nthe city (36c–d). He went so far as to claim that as a civic\\nbenefactor, he deserved not death but the lifelong publicly provided\\nmeals commonly awarded to an Olympic champion (36e–37a).\\nSocrates here depicts himself as a new kind of citizen,\\nconceptualizing the public good in a new way and so serving it best\\nthrough unprecedented actions, in contrast to the conventionally\\ndefined paths of political contest and success (Villa 2001).\\n\\nWhile depicting himself in his defense speeches in Plato’s\\nApology as a new kind of virtuous citizen, Socrates makes\\nthree remarks which have in modern times been seized upon as\\nindications of the principled limits which he might have put on the\\nrequirement to obey the law. The first two recalled political\\nincidents: while serving on the Council, he had voted against an\\nillegal proposal (32b–c); and under the brief oligarchical\\ndomination of “The Thirty”, he had disobeyed an order of\\nthe ruling body to arrest a democratic partisan for execution\\n(32c–d). The third is a hypothetical remark. If, he imagines,\\nthe jurors were to say to him, “we acquit you, but only on\\ncondition that you spend no more time on this investigation and do not\\npractice philosophy, and if you are caught doing so you will\\ndie,” his reply would be: “I will obey the god rather than\\nyou, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to\\npractice philosophy” (both quotations excerpted from longer\\nsentences, 29c–d). Particularly in twentieth-century Anglophone\\nscholarship, these remarks have engendered a view of Socrates as\\nendorsing civil disobedience in certain circumstances, and so have\\nframed the question of civil disobedience and the grounds for\\npolitical obligation as arising in Plato. A significant debate on\\nthese matters took shape in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s\\nat the time of widespread civil disobedience relating to civil rights\\nand the Vietnam War: see for example Konvitz 1964, Woozley 1972.', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 7.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'})]"

He went so far as to claim that as a civic\\nbenefactor, he deserved not death but the lifelong publicly provided\\nmeals commonly awarded to an Olympic champion (36e–37a).\\nSocrates here depicts himself as a new kind of citizen,\\nconceptualizing the public good in a new way and so serving it best\\nthrough unprecedented actions, in contrast to the conventionally\\ndefined paths of political contest and success (Villa 2001).\\n\\nWhile depicting himself in his defense speeches in Plato’s\\nApology as a new kind of virtuous citizen, Socrates makes\\nthree remarks which have in modern times been seized upon as\\nindications of the principled limits which he might have put on the\\nrequirement to obey the law. The first two recalled political\\nincidents: while serving on the Council, he had voted against an\\nillegal proposal (32b–c); and under the brief oligarchical\\ndomination of “The Thirty”, he had disobeyed an order of\\nthe ruling body to arrest a democratic partisan for execution\\n(32c–d).

       "   Document(page_content=\"Coming from the theories of Plato and Aristotle, the first thing that\\nmight strike us about the theories of soul adopted by the two dominant\\nHellenistic schools, Epicurus' Garden and the Stoa, is the doctrine,\\nshared by both, that the soul is corporeal. A number of Stoic\\narguments for the claim that the soul is a body have come down to us\\n(see Annas 1992, 39-41). The best one of these is that the soul is a\\nbody because (roughly) only bodies affect one another, and soul and\\nbody do affect one another, for instance in cases of bodily damage and\\nemotion. Epicurus employs the same argument in his Letter to\\nHerodotus, which provides an outline of his physical doctrines\\n(Long & Sedley 1987 [in what follows L&S] 14A7). In a way that\\nreminds one of Presocratic theories, both Epicurus and the Stoics hold\\nthat the soul is a particularly fine kind of body, diffused all the\\nway through the perceptible (flesh-and-blood) body of the animate\\norganism. As if echoing the view of the soul that Simmias in the\\nPhaedo presents as the majority view, Epicurus thinks that the\\nsoul is dispersed at death along with its constituent atoms, losing\\nthe powers that it has while it is contained by the body of the\\norganism that it ensouls (L&S 14A6). The Stoics agree that the\\nhuman soul is mortal, but they also take it that it can and does\\nsurvive the person's death — that is, its separation from the\\nperceptible body.

Answering both\\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\\ntime of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of\\nargument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the\\nimmortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls\\nenjoy lives of thought and intelligence.

The argument that\\nsheds most light on what Plato takes the nature of the soul to be is\\nthe affinity argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the\\nwidespread worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed\\nby being dispersed.  It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of\\nthings: on the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of\\nparts, and subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand,\\nthings that are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by\\nthought), not composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and\\ndestruction.

Thus the argument leaves room for the idea\\nthat souls are not forms, but are nevertheless intelligible, partless\\nand imperishable (contra Robinson 1995, 29). In fact, in\\nframing the argument in the way he does Plato furnishes the conceptual\\nframework needed for saying that body and soul differ in kind, the one\\nbeing perceptible and perishable, the other being intelligible and\\nexempt from destruction.

A number of Stoic\\narguments for the claim that the soul is a body have come down to us\\n(see Annas 1992, 39-41). The best one of these is that the soul is a\\nbody because (roughly) only bodies affect one another, and soul and\\nbody do affect one another, for instance in cases of bodily damage and\\nemotion.

As if echoing the view of the soul that Simmias in the\\nPhaedo presents as the majority view, Epicurus thinks that the\\nsoul is dispersed at death along with its constituent atoms, losing\\nthe powers that it has while it is contained by the body of the\\norganism that it ensouls (L&S 14A6).

Asserting in Plato’s Apology (38a)\\nthat “the unexamined life is not worth living,” he pressed\\nfor definitions of the virtues or excellences which were widely\\nrecognized and claimed by his fellows, but which they found difficult\\nto explain. As depicted by Plato, the search for such definitions led\\ninvariably to a concern with knowledge of how best to live, as not\\nonly one of the conventional virtues (in the form of wisdom) but also\\nas underpinning, even constituting, them all. That elevation of\\nknowledge in turn led Socrates to militate against the practices of\\nrhetoric and judgment which animated political institutions of Athens\\nsuch as the law-courts, Assembly and Council. Instead he posited the\\nexistence, or at least the possibility, of political expertise,\\nclaiming (in Plato’s Gorgias) to be the one person in\\nAthens who at least tried to pursue such a true politikê\\ntechnê, a complex notion that can be understood as meaning\\npolitics as a kind of professional expertise (Grg. 521d). The\\nnotion of political knowledge limited to one or a few experts, as\\nopposed to the embedded and networked knowledge produced and exercised\\nby the whole dêmos of Athens in their judgments and\\npolitical roles (Ober 2008), struck at the central premises of\\nAthenian democracy and those of Greek politics more generally (in\\noligarchies, wealth rather than knowledge was the relevant criterion\\nfor rule; in tyrannies, sheer power).

A significant debate on\\nthese matters took shape in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s\\nat the time of widespread civil disobedience relating to civil rights\\nand the Vietnam War: see for example Konvitz 1964, Woozley 1972.', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 7.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'}),\n",
       "   Document(page_content=\"Moreover, apart from the question of immortality or otherwise, there\\nis the further question whether the soul, if it does have some form of\\nexistence after the person has died, “still possesses some power\\nand wisdom” (Phaedo, 70b; cf. 76c).  Answering both\\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\\ntime of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of\\nargument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the\\nimmortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls\\nenjoy lives of thought and intelligence. The arguments have been\\ndiscussed in some detail, for instance in Bostock 1986, and for our\\npurposes there is no need to state and analyze them systematically. It\\nwill suffice to comment selectively on aspects of the arguments that\\nbear directly on Plato's conception of the soul. The argument that\\nsheds most light on what Plato takes the nature of the soul to be is\\nthe affinity argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the\\nwidespread worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed\\nby being dispersed.  It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of\\nthings: on the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of\\nparts, and subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand,\\nthings that are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by\\nthought), not composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and\\ndestruction. These two categories are obviously mutually exclusive. It\\nis not clear whether or not they are meant to be exhaustive.\\nMoreover, the category of imperishable, intelligible being is\\nexemplified, but not, it seems, exhausted, by Platonic forms such as\\nequality, beauty and the like (contra Bostock 1986, 118).\\nIntelligible being evidently includes what Socrates calls the divine,\\nwhose nature it is to rule and to lead (80a), and there is no\\nindication that the forms exhaust the divine, or even include the\\ndivine, so understood.  Thus the argument leaves room for the idea\\nthat souls are not forms, but are nevertheless intelligible, partless\\nand imperishable (contra Robinson 1995, 29). In fact, in\\nframing the argument in the way he does Plato furnishes the conceptual\\nframework needed for saying that body and soul differ in kind, the one\\nbeing perceptible and perishable, the other being intelligible and\\nexempt from destruction. However, the argument does not support such a\\nstrong conclusion, and Socrates is aware of this.\", metadata={'article_id': '76', 'authors': ['Hendrik Lorenz --- hlorenz@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 10.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-soul', 'date': '2009', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-soul/', 'title': 'Ancient Theories of Soul'})])}"

He went so far as to claim that as a civic\\nbenefactor, he deserved not death but the lifelong publicly provided\\nmeals commonly awarded to an Olympic champion (36e–37a).\\nSocrates here depicts himself as a new kind of citizen,\\nconceptualizing the public good in a new way and so serving it best\\nthrough unprecedented actions, in contrast to the conventionally\\ndefined paths of political contest and success (Villa 2001).\\n\\nWhile depicting himself in his defense speeches in Plato’s\\nApology as a new kind of virtuous citizen, Socrates makes\\nthree remarks which have in modern times been seized upon as\\nindications of the principled limits which he might have put on the\\nrequirement to obey the law. The first two recalled political\\nincidents: while serving on the Council, he had voted against an\\nillegal proposal (32b–c); and under the brief oligarchical\\ndomination of “The Thirty”, he had disobeyed an order of\\nthe ruling body to arrest a democratic partisan for execution\\n(32c–d). The third is a hypothetical remark. If, he imagines,\\nthe jurors were to say to him, “we acquit you, but only on\\ncondition that you spend no more time on this investigation and do not\\npractice philosophy, and if you are caught doing so you will\\ndie,” his reply would be: “I will obey the god rather than\\nyou, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to\\npractice philosophy” (both quotations excerpted from longer\\nsentences, 29c–d). Particularly in twentieth-century Anglophone\\nscholarship, these remarks have engendered a view of Socrates as\\nendorsing civil disobedience in certain circumstances, and so have\\nframed the question of civil disobedience and the grounds for\\npolitical obligation as arising in Plato. A significant debate on\\nthese matters took shape in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s\\nat the time of widespread civil disobedience relating to civil rights\\nand the Vietnam War: see for example Konvitz 1964, Woozley 1972.\"}"

Before that moment, Plato imagines Socrates\\nbeing visited in prison by his friend Crito (in a dialogue which bears\\nthe latter’s name), and urged to escape for the sake of his\\nfriends and family, a practice which was frequently tolerated in\\nAthens so long as the escapee fled into exile. Socrates is not\\npersuaded by Crito’s arguments. He begins his examination of\\nthem by recalling principles to which he and Crito had in the past\\nagreed, including the principle that it is better to suffer injustice\\nthan to commit it (Cri. 47a–50a). He then goes on to\\nventriloquize a series of speeches against escape, which he ascribes\\nto the “Laws of\\n Athens”.[6]\\n These speeches articulate a set of special connections between\\nSocrates and the Laws of Athens which, depending on one’s\\nreading, either flesh out the principle that it is better to suffer\\ninjustice than to do it (by dramatizing reasons for which it would\\nunjust for Socrates to escape), or else stand in tension with it by\\ninvoking absolutist grounds with implications more extensive than such\\na principle would authorize (Harte 1999). On any reading, it is\\nimportant to bear in mind that Socrates is choosing to obey a jury\\nverdict that has commanded him to suffer what is arguably an\\ninjustice, but not to commit one, so that one of his fundamental\\nethical principles here as elsewhere in Plato (that it is better to\\nsuffer an injustice than to commit one) is at least compatible with\\nhis acceptance of the jury’s sentence.\\n\\nThe “Laws of Athens” appeal to a kind of social contract\\nmade between themselves and Socrates. The contract is unequal: the\\n“Laws” compare themselves to parents and slaveowners, and\\nSocrates to child and slave. Obedience to them is owed, they claim,\\nbecause the “Laws” have provided the whole basis for\\nSocrates’ education and life in the city, a city in which he has\\nnotably chosen to remain, never traveling abroad except on military\\nservice. But the “Laws” also speak of the opportunity they\\nafford to Socrates to “persuade or obey” them (51b;\\n51e–52a). The meaning of this clause and its relevance to civil\\ndisobedience is again much debated (Kraut 1984 remains a landmark).\\nNevertheless, the image of Socrates tried, convicted, and made to die\\n(by his own hand) at the city’s command has come to be a vivid\\nand powerful symbol of tension in the relationship between political\\nphilosophy and political authority.\\n3.3 The Defense of Justice in the Republic', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 8.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"It hardly needs pointing out, then, that the soul, as Plato conceives\\nof it in the Phaedo, is crucially characterized by cognitive\\nand intellectual features: it is something that reasons, more or less\\nwell depending on the extent to which it is disturbed or distracted by\\nthe body and the senses; something that regulates and controls the\\nbody and its desires and affections, “especially if it is a wise\\nsoul” (94b), presumably in a way that involves, and renders\\neffective, judgments about what it is best to do, and how it is best\\nto behave; and something that has, as the kind of adornment that is\\ntruly appropriate to it, virtues such as temperance, justice and\\ncourage (114e f.). However, it should be clear that the soul, as it is\\nconceived of here, is not simply the mind, as we conceive of it. It is\\nboth broader and narrower than that. It is broader in that Plato\\nevidently retains the traditional idea of soul as distinguishing the\\nanimate from the inanimate. Two of the four main lines of argument for\\nthe immortality of the soul rely not on cognitive or indeed\\nspecifically psychological features of the soul, but simply on the\\nfamiliar connection between soul and life. According to the cyclical\\nargument (70c-72d), being alive in general is preceded by, just as it\\nprecedes, being dead.  Socrates takes this to show that a creature's\\ndeath involves the continued existence of the soul in question, which\\npersists through a period of separation from body, and then returns to\\nanimate another body in a change which is the counterpart of the\\nprevious change, dying. According to the last line of argument that\\nSocrates offers in the Phaedo, the soul is immortal because it\\nhas life essentially, the way fire has heat essentially.

       " Document(page_content=\"It hardly needs pointing out, then, that the soul, as Plato conceives\\nof it in the Phaedo, is crucially characterized by cognitive\\nand intellectual features: it is something that reasons, more or less\\nwell depending on the extent to which it is disturbed or distracted by\\nthe body and the senses; something that regulates and controls the\\nbody and its desires and affections, “especially if it is a wise\\nsoul” (94b), presumably in a way that involves, and renders\\neffective, judgments about what it is best to do, and how it is best\\nto behave; and something that has, as the kind of adornment that is\\ntruly appropriate to it, virtues such as temperance, justice and\\ncourage (114e f.). However, it should be clear that the soul, as it is\\nconceived of here, is not simply the mind, as we conceive of it. It is\\nboth broader and narrower than that. It is broader in that Plato\\nevidently retains the traditional idea of soul as distinguishing the\\nanimate from the inanimate. Two of the four main lines of argument for\\nthe immortality of the soul rely not on cognitive or indeed\\nspecifically psychological features of the soul, but simply on the\\nfamiliar connection between soul and life. According to the cyclical\\nargument (70c-72d), being alive in general is preceded by, just as it\\nprecedes, being dead.  Socrates takes this to show that a creature's\\ndeath involves the continued existence of the soul in question, which\\npersists through a period of separation from body, and then returns to\\nanimate another body in a change which is the counterpart of the\\nprevious change, dying. According to the last line of argument that\\nSocrates offers in the Phaedo, the soul is immortal because it\\nhas life essentially, the way fire has heat essentially. It is plain\\nthat both of these arguments apply to the souls of all living things,\\nincluding plants (cf. 70d, 71d). And in the final argument, Socrates\\nexplicitly appeals to the idea that it is the soul that animates the\\nbody of a living thing (105c): \\n\\nWhat is it that, when present in a body, makes it living? — A\\nsoul.\", metadata={'article_id': '76', 'authors': ['Hendrik Lorenz --- hlorenz@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 13.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-soul', 'date': '2009', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-soul/', 'title': 'Ancient Theories of Soul'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Socrates’ speeches in the court trial—literary versions of\\nwhich were produced by Plato, Xenophon, and a number of other\\nfollowers—forced him to confront directly the question of his\\nrole in an Athens defined by its democratic institutions and norms.\\nSocrates had played his part as an ordinary citizen, allowing his name\\nto go forward for selection by lot to serve on the Council, and\\nserving in the army when required. But he had not engaged actively in\\n“public affairs” (ta pragmata, Apol.\\n32e): he had not spoken in the Assembly (31c), nor, so far as we know,\\nbrought any prosecutions in the law-courts. In Plato’s account,\\nafter countering the religious accusations, Socrates acknowledged this\\nabstention from public affairs but claimed to have had a more\\nsignificant mission laid on him by the god Apollo when his oracle at\\nDelphi declared that no man was wiser than Socrates: his mission was\\nto stir up the city like a gadfly (30e), discussing virtue and related\\nmatters (38a), and benefiting each person by “trying to persuade\\nhim” to care for virtue rather than wealth for himself and for\\nthe city (36c–d). He went so far as to claim that as a civic\\nbenefactor, he deserved not death but the lifelong publicly provided\\nmeals commonly awarded to an Olympic champion (36e–37a).\\nSocrates here depicts himself as a new kind of citizen,\\nconceptualizing the public good in a new way and so serving it best\\nthrough unprecedented actions, in contrast to the conventionally\\ndefined paths of political contest and success (Villa 2001).\\n\\nWhile depicting himself in his defense speeches in Plato’s\\nApology as a new kind of virtuous citizen, Socrates makes\\nthree remarks which have in modern times been seized upon as\\nindications of the principled limits which he might have put on the\\nrequirement to obey the law. The first two recalled political\\nincidents: while serving on the Council, he had voted against an\\nillegal proposal (32b–c); and under the brief oligarchical\\ndomination of “The Thirty”, he had disobeyed an order of\\nthe ruling body to arrest a democratic partisan for execution\\n(32c–d). The third is a hypothetical remark. If, he imagines,\\nthe jurors were to say to him, “we acquit you, but only on\\ncondition that you spend no more time on this investigation and do not\\npractice philosophy, and if you are caught doing so you will\\ndie,” his reply would be: “I will obey the god rather than\\nyou, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to\\npractice philosophy” (both quotations excerpted from longer\\nsentences, 29c–d). Particularly in twentieth-century Anglophone\\nscholarship, these remarks have engendered a view of Socrates as\\nendorsing civil disobedience in certain circumstances, and so have\\nframed the question of civil disobedience and the grounds for\\npolitical obligation as arising in Plato. A significant debate on\\nthese matters took shape in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s\\nat the time of widespread civil disobedience relating to civil rights\\nand the Vietnam War: see for example Konvitz 1964, Woozley 1972.', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 7.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'})]"
