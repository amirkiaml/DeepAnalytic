To say this is plainly neither\\nto assert nor to imply (as Robinson 1995, 30, appears to think) that\\nsoul in some way or other falls short of intelligible, imperishable\\nbeing, any more than it is to assert or imply that body in some way or\\nother falls short of, or rather rises above, perceptible, perishable\\nbeing. The argument leaves it open whether soul is a perfectly\\nrespectable member of intelligible reality, the way human bodies are\\nperfectly respectable members of perceptible reality, or whether,\\nalternatively, soul has some intermediate status in between\\nintelligible and perceptible being, rising above the latter, but\\nmerely approximating to the former. Socrates does seem to take his\\nconclusion to imply, or at least strongly suggest, that it is natural\\nfor the soul either “to be altogether indissoluble, or nearly\\nso”, but, in any case, that the soul is less subject to\\ndissolution and destruction than the body, rather than, as the popular\\nview has it, more so. If this position can be established, Socrates is\\nin a position to refute the popular view that the soul, being composed\\nof ethereal stuff, is more liable to dispersion and destruction\\nthan the body.  However, as Cebes points out (88b), unless Socrates\\ncan establish that the soul is altogether exempt from destruction,\\nconfidence of survival in the face of death is misplaced. Socrates'\\nsoul may be a great deal more durable than his body, but as long as it\\nis not truly imperishable, there can be no guarantee that it will\\nsurvive Socrates' impending death. For it might have experienced any\\nnumber of incarnations already, and the current one might be its\\nlast. So Socrates launches his most elaborate and final argument for\\nthe immortality of the soul, which concludes that since life belongs\\nto soul essentially, the soul must be deathless — that is,\\nimmortal.\", metadata={'article_id': '76', 'authors': ['Hendrik Lorenz --- hlorenz@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 11.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-soul', 'date': '2009', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-soul/', 'title': 'Ancient Theories of Soul'}), Document(page_content='Socrates’ speeches in the court trial—literary versions of\\nwhich were produced by Plato, Xenophon, and a number of other\\nfollowers—forced him to confront directly the question of his\\nrole in an Athens defined by its democratic institutions and norms.\\nSocrates had played his part as an ordinary citizen, allowing his name\\nto go forward for selection by lot to serve on the Council, and\\nserving in the army when required. But he had not engaged actively in\\n“public affairs” (ta pragmata, Apol.\\n32e): he had not spoken in the Assembly (31c), nor, so far as we know,\\nbrought any prosecutions in the law-courts. In Plato’s account,\\nafter countering the religious accusations, Socrates acknowledged this\\nabstention from public affairs but claimed to have had a more\\nsignificant mission laid on him by the god Apollo when his oracle at\\nDelphi declared that no man was wiser than Socrates: his mission was\\nto stir up the city like a gadfly (30e), discussing virtue and related\\nmatters (38a), and benefiting each person by “trying to persuade\\nhim” to care for virtue rather than wealth for himself and for\\nthe city (36c–d). He went so far as to claim that as a civic\\nbenefactor, he deserved not death but the lifelong publicly provided\\nmeals commonly awarded to an Olympic champion (36e–37a).\\nSocrates here depicts himself as a new kind of citizen,\\nconceptualizing the public good in a new way and so serving it best\\nthrough unprecedented actions, in contrast to the conventionally\\ndefined paths of political contest and success (Villa 2001).\\n\\nWhile depicting himself in his defense speeches in Plato’s\\nApology as a new kind of virtuous citizen, Socrates makes\\nthree remarks which have in modern times been seized upon as\\nindications of the principled limits which he might have put on the\\nrequirement to obey the law. The first two recalled political\\nincidents: while serving on the Council, he had voted against an\\nillegal proposal (32b–c); and under the brief oligarchical\\ndomination of “The Thirty”, he had disobeyed an order of\\nthe ruling body to arrest a democratic partisan for execution\\n(32c–d). The third is a hypothetical remark. If, he imagines,\\nthe jurors were to say to him, “we acquit you, but only on\\ncondition that you spend no more time on this investigation and do not\\npractice philosophy, and if you are caught doing so you will\\ndie,” his reply would be: “I will obey the god rather than\\nyou, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to\\npractice philosophy” (both quotations excerpted from longer\\nsentences, 29c–d). Particularly in twentieth-century Anglophone\\nscholarship, these remarks have engendered a view of Socrates as\\nendorsing civil disobedience in certain circumstances, and so have\\nframed the question of civil disobedience and the grounds for\\npolitical obligation as arising in Plato. A significant debate on\\nthese matters took shape in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s\\nat the time of widespread civil disobedience relating to civil rights\\nand the Vietnam War: see for example Konvitz 1964, Woozley 1972.', metadata={'article_id': '75', 'authors': ['Melissa Lane --- mslane@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 7.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-political', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-political/', 'title': 'Ancient Political Philosophy'}), Document(page_content=\"Moreover, apart from the question of immortality or otherwise, there\\nis the further question whether the soul, if it does have some form of\\nexistence after the person has died, “still possesses some power\\nand wisdom” (Phaedo, 70b; cf. 76c).  Answering both\\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\\ntime of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of\\nargument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the\\nimmortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls\\nenjoy lives of thought and intelligence. The arguments have been\\ndiscussed in some detail, for instance in Bostock 1986, and for our\\npurposes there is no need to state and analyze them systematically. It\\nwill suffice to comment selectively on aspects of the arguments that\\nbear directly on Plato's conception of the soul. The argument that\\nsheds most light on what Plato takes the nature of the soul to be is\\nthe affinity argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the\\nwidespread worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed\\nby being dispersed.  It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of\\nthings: on the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of\\nparts, and subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand,\\nthings that are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by\\nthought), not composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and\\ndestruction. These two categories are obviously mutually exclusive. It\\nis not clear whether or not they are meant to be exhaustive.\\nMoreover, the category of imperishable, intelligible being is\\nexemplified, but not, it seems, exhausted, by Platonic forms such as\\nequality, beauty and the like (contra Bostock 1986, 118).\\nIntelligible being evidently includes what Socrates calls the divine,\\nwhose nature it is to rule and to lead (80a), and there is no\\nindication that the forms exhaust the divine, or even include the\\ndivine, so understood.  Thus the argument leaves room for the idea\\nthat souls are not forms, but are nevertheless intelligible, partless\\nand imperishable (contra Robinson 1995, 29). In fact, in\\nframing the argument in the way he does Plato furnishes the conceptual\\nframework needed for saying that body and soul differ in kind, the one\\nbeing perceptible and perishable, the other being intelligible and\\nexempt from destruction. However, the argument does not support such a\\nstrong conclusion, and Socrates is aware of this.\", metadata={'article_id': '76', 'authors': ['Hendrik Lorenz --- hlorenz@princeton.edu'], 'chunk': 10.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=ancient-soul', 'date': '2009', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/ancient-soul/', 'title': 'Ancient Theories of Soul'})] \n",

To say this is plainly neither\\nto assert nor to imply (as Robinson 1995, 30, appears to think) that\\nsoul in some way or other falls short of intelligible, imperishable\\nbeing, any more than it is to assert or imply that body in some way or\\nother falls short of, or rather rises above, perceptible, perishable\\nbeing. The argument leaves it open whether soul is a perfectly\\nrespectable member of intelligible reality, the way human bodies are\\nperfectly respectable members of perceptible reality, or whether,\\nalternatively, soul has some intermediate status in between\\nintelligible and perceptible being, rising above the latter, but\\nmerely approximating to the former. Socrates does seem to take his\\nconclusion to imply, or at least strongly suggest, that it is natural\\nfor the soul either “to be altogether indissoluble, or nearly\\nso”, but, in any case, that the soul is less subject to\\ndissolution and destruction than the body, rather than, as the popular\\nview has it, more so. If this position can be established, Socrates is\\nin a position to refute the popular view that the soul, being composed\\nof ethereal stuff, is more liable to dispersion and destruction\\nthan the body.  However, as Cebes points out (88b), unless Socrates\\ncan establish that the soul is altogether exempt from destruction,\\nconfidence of survival in the face of death is misplaced. Socrates'\\nsoul may be a great deal more durable than his body, but as long as it\\nis not truly imperishable, there can be no guarantee that it will\\nsurvive Socrates' impending death. For it might have experienced any\\nnumber of incarnations already, and the current one might be its\\nlast. So Socrates launches his most elaborate and final argument for\\nthe immortality of the soul, which concludes that since life belongs\\nto soul essentially, the soul must be deathless — that is,\\nimmortal.\""

If we know\\nthat it is impossible for individual persons to survive biological\\ndeath, speculation on an afterlife we might expect or hope for would\\nbe pointless (unless it serves some purpose in terms of fiction), but\\nit would not be pointless to reflect on whether the impossibility of\\nan afterlife should dominate our values in this life. What are the\\nimplications for our lives now if we take seriously the idea that at\\ndeath we will pass into oblivion? Some philosophers adopt a strategy\\nlike Singer’s and Wielenberg’s about our individual lives.\\nIn Religion Without God Ronald Dworkin is candid about\\n“what we desperately dread”, namely “the total,\\nobliterating, itself unimaginable, snuffing out of everything”\\n(2013: 150). While he thinks some kind of individual afterlife may be\\npossible (even given atheistic naturalism) he does propose a\\n“kind of immortality” which is “the only kind we\\nhave any business wanting” (Dworkin 2013: 159).\\n\\n\\nWhen you do something smaller well—play a tune or a part or a\\nhand, throw a curve or a compliment, make a chair or a sonnet or\\nlove—your satisfaction is complete in itself. Those are\\nachievements within life. Why can’t a life also be an\\nachievement complete in itself, with its own value in the art in\\nliving it displays?

If\\nindividual survival of death is impossible, then Dworkin is right to\\ncast aside (as he does) the comedian Woody Allen’s aspiration to\\nlive on forever, not in his work, but in his apartment. But do we know\\nthat an individual afterlife is impossible? Later in this entry, we\\nsuggest that ruling out an afterlife as impossible is philosophically\\ntenuous.  Moreover, we suggest that the goods within the life that\\nDworkin describes invite us to consider whether human lives may be\\nricher still if they do not end in oblivion and instead death marks a\\ntransition to a form of afterlife that some of the world religions\\nenvision. For an interesting secular case that many of our values in\\nthe present moment are tied to expectations of the future, see\\nScheffler 2016 (N.B. Scheffler is concerned with future events in this\\nlife rather than an individual’s life after their death.) For\\nmore recent reflection on the relevance of an afterlife for the\\nmeaning of life now, see Mawson 2019 and 2020.\\n\\nSo, we suggest that the topic of an afterlife is warranted for at\\nleast three reasons: it is important if you love persons in this life\\nand hope for their enduring flourishing (or hope they are not\\nannihilated or meet a worse fate); it is important to think about the\\nimplications of there not being an afterlife (or there being one) in\\nterms of how to understand what is important to you now; and it is\\nimportant to consider for historical reasons: speculation and beliefs\\nabout life after death have existed through much of human history.', metadata={'article_id': '34', 'authors': ['William Hasker --- No email provided', 'Charles Taliaferro --- taliafer@stolaf.edu'], 'chunk': 7.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=afterlife', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/afterlife/', 'title': 'Afterlife'}), Document(page_content='Our focus for much of the rest of this\\nentry is on the possibility and the reasonability of believing there\\nis an afterlife for individual persons, though we will offer some\\nobservations along the way about the kinds of afterlife that are\\npossible, given different metaphysical assumptions.

It would not be admirable for the aid workers in\\nSinger’s example to pause in their work in order to hold\\ndeath-and-dying seminars. However, while there might be nothing wrong\\nin living without wrestling with mortality, there are sufficient good\\nreasons why the topics of the nature of death and the existence (or\\nnon-existence) of an afterlife are philosophically interesting and\\ndeserving of attention.\\n\\nAs we turn to the question of whether it is possible for persons to\\nsurvive death, it is natural to pursue an answer in light of the\\nphilosophy of human persons.
