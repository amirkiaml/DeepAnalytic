      "philosopher at the University of Leipzig who counted Leibniz among his\n",
      "students. Christian (hereafter simply ‘Thomasius’)\n",
      "matriculated in the philosophy faculty at Leipzig in 1669, and was\n",
      "promoted to Magister artium in 1672. As a result of his\n",
      "father’s lectures, particularly on Hugo Grotius’ De\n",
      "jure belli ac pacis, and his interest in Samuel Pufendorf’s\n",
      "De jure naturae et gentium, Thomasius took up the study of\n",
      "law in Frankfurt an der Oder in 1675 and was awarded a doctorate in\n",
      "1679. After a brief journey to Holland, Thomasius returned to Leipzig\n",
      "where he worked (unhappily) as a lawyer while also holding private\n",
      "lectures on natural jurisprudence. Thomasius attests to the\n",
      "fundamental reorientation of his thinking effected by his reading of\n",
      "Pufendorf, and the Apologia pro se et suo libro (1674) in\n",
      "particular, which he credits for convincing him of the independence of\n",
      "natural law from theology as well as of the need to question authority\n",
      "and resist religious intolerance (Thomasius 1688a, “Diss.\n",
      "Proem.” §§5–10; Hochstrasser 2000:\n",
      "113–121). This new anti-authoritarian cast of mind is clearly\n",

      "but we can also distinguish the soul’s representations in terms\n",
      "of their content. Accordingly, they can be classified into sensations,\n",

      "various faculties of the soul, including sensibility, imagination, and\n",

      "ourselves so that we can be moved to act in (what are in fact) the\n",
      "most perfect ways. Promoting the perfection of ourselves and others\n",

      "ought to choose between two (or more) possible actions (GE §12).\n",
      "That is to say, when making a free choice we ought to consider whether\n",
      "the action “promotes the perfection of our inner and outer\n",
      "state” (GE §2) and that means considering whether the state\n",
      "of the soul and the body accords with the prior state or contradicts\n",
      "it. The outcome has greater perfection to the extent that it\n",
      "contributes to the continued “natural human state and its\n",
      "harmonious preservation over time”(GE §2). The natural\n",
      "human state Wolff envisions is the state of the soul in its manifold\n",
      "efforts to find truth, and everything has to be done to maximize that\n",
      "state. It so happens, that this is where happiness lies as well, and\n",
      "as Wolff indicates at the end of the ethics, it is incumbent upon\n",
      "human beings to ensure not only their own perfection/happiness, but to\n",

      "ideals. The Pietists sought the personal and interior experience of a\n",
      "relationship to Christ, an individual transformation that was the\n",
      "result of an act of divine grace modelled on Francke’s own\n",
      "conversion experience (cf. Wallmann 1990: 63–4). To this end,\n",
      "the Pietists focused on the study of the Bible itself and devotional\n",
      "literature in small groups—the so-called conventicles or\n",
      "collegia pietatis—which were notable, and\n",
      "controversial, for welcoming the involvement of women (R. Albrecht\n",

      "disciple of the movement’s intellectual founder, Philipp Jakob\n",
      "Spener (1635–1705), though Francke contributed immeasurably to\n",
      "the spread of Pietism, primarily through his educational institutions\n",
      "in Halle, beginning with a school for poor children founded in 1695.\n",
      "Through the institutions that arose from this humble school, Francke\n",
      "sought a reform of educational principles in line with Pietist ideals,\n",
      "and in this was enormously successful. The pedagogical institutions\n",
      "supplied an influential model for similar institutions in and outside\n",
      "of Germany (especially due to the fact that it was a largely\n",

       "['Title: 18th Century German Philosophy Prior to Kant\\n\\nText: \\n1. Christian Thomasius\\n1.1 Life and Works',\n",
       " 'Christian Thomasius was born on 1 January 1655 in Leipzig. He was the\\nson of Jakob Thomasius (1622–84), a well-known jurist and\\nphilosopher at the University of Leipzig who counted Leibniz among his\\nstudents. Christian (hereafter simply ‘Thomasius’)\\nmatriculated in the philosophy faculty at Leipzig in 1669, and was\\npromoted to Magister artium in 1672. As a result of his\\nfather’s lectures, particularly on Hugo Grotius’ De\\njure belli ac pacis, and his interest in Samuel Pufendorf’s\\nDe jure naturae et gentium, Thomasius took up the study of\\nlaw in Frankfurt an der Oder in 1675 and was awarded a doctorate in\\n1679. After a brief journey to Holland, Thomasius returned to Leipzig\\nwhere he worked (unhappily) as a lawyer while also holding private\\nlectures on natural jurisprudence. Thomasius attests to the\\nfundamental reorientation of his thinking effected by his reading of\\nPufendorf, and the Apologia pro se et suo libro (1674) in\\nparticular, which he credits for convincing him of the independence of\\nnatural law from theology as well as of the need to question authority\\nand resist religious intolerance (Thomasius 1688a, “Diss.\\nProem.” §§5–10; Hochstrasser 2000:\\n113–121). This new anti-authoritarian cast of mind is clearly\\nevident in a dissertation on bigamy of 1685, in which Thomasius\\ndefends the practice as consistent with natural law, and which\\nunsurprisingly led to a confrontation with a professor in the theology\\nfaculty at Leipzig. Thomasius’ pioneering decision to hold',\n",
       " 'faculty at Leipzig. Thomasius’ pioneering decision to hold\\nlectures in German, announced (in German) in 1687, likewise provoked\\ncontroversy, as did his publication beginning in 1688 of a monthly\\njournal (the first periodical published in German), entitled the\\nMonatsgespräche, in which Thomasius commented,\\nfrequently satirically, on the local intellectual scene.\\nThomasius’ lectures and publications increasingly generated\\nconflict with the theological faculty in Leipzig, which upheld a\\nrather strict form of Lutheran orthodoxy, and while his connections\\nwith the Saxon court stood him in good stead for a time, his defence\\nof an inter-faith marriage involving a (Lutheran) Saxon count and a\\n(Calvinist) Brandenburg princess cost him his protection, and in March\\n1690 he was prohibited from publishing and holding lectures (private\\nand academic) in Electoral Saxony.',\n",
       " 'Thomasius sought refuge in Berlin, in the neighbouring state of\\nBrandenburg which was led by the Calvinist Elector Friedrich III\\n(later king Friedrich I) and had a tradition of toleration. Partly\\nthrough the support of Pufendorf himself, Thomasius was given an\\nappointment as councillor to the court, and was allowed to lecture at\\nthe Ritterakademie in Halle an der Saale, which in 1694 would become\\nthe Friedrichs-Universität, with Thomasius among the founding\\nfaculty (in law). Thomasius was soon joined by the Pietist\\norientalist, theologian and educational reformer, August Hermann\\nFrancke, who had likewise run afoul of the religious authorities in\\nLeipzig. Thomasius himself had been sympathetic with the\\nanti-scholastic and anti-authoritarian bent of the Pietists (see\\n §3.2\\n below), and had publicly defended Francke at one point in Leipzig;\\nhowever, a public break occurred when Thomasius published a criticism,\\nin 1699, of the pedagogy Francke had adopted in his famous educational\\ninstitutions in Halle. Thomasius continued to stir controversy with\\nhis lectures and publications, which frequently over-reached the\\npurview of the juristic faculty (such as his critical discussion of\\nwitchcraft trials—Beck 1969: 253–254), and breached\\ndecorum by personally attacking his theological colleagues, all of\\nwhich led to a reprimand from the Brandenburg court in 1702 and an\\norder to adhere to the boundaries between faculties. Thomasius’\\ndissertation De concubinatu of 1713, in which he contended\\nthat the use of concubines does not violate the marriage contract\\ngiven that the purpose of marriage is solely procreation, also\\ngenerated heated discussion. While Thomasius and Francke reconciled in',\n",
       " 'generated heated discussion. While Thomasius and Francke reconciled in\\n1714, Thomasius did not play a significant role in the later\\ncontroversy between Wolff and the Pietists. He died in Halle on 23\\nSeptember 1728.',\n",
       " 'Thomasius’ works cover a wide range of topics. In addition to\\nthe topical essays and dissertations already mentioned, Thomasius\\npublished major texts on natural law, including the Institutiones\\njurisprudentiae divinae (Institutions of Divine\\nJurisprudence) of 1688 and the Fundamentum iuris naturae et\\ngentium (Foundations of the Law of Nature and Nations)\\nof 1705 (for discussion of Thomasius’ contributions to natural\\nlaw theory, which will not be taken up here, see especially\\nHochstrasser 2000: ch. 4; Kühnel 2001; and Lutterbeck 2002).\\nThomasius also published on topics in theoretical and practical\\nphilosophy, especially during his time in Halle. Thomasius wrote a\\nnumber of texts on logic, such as the Introductio ad philosophiam\\nauliam (Introduction to Court Philosophy) of 1688, as\\nwell as the Einleitung zur Vernunfft-Lehre (Introduction\\nto the Doctrine of Reason) and the Ausübung der\\nVernunfft-Lehre (Application of the Doctrine of Reason)\\nboth of 1691. These were followed by a parallel exhibition of his\\nmoral philosophy in the Einleitung zur Sitten-Lehre\\n(Introduction to the Doctrine of Morals) of 1692 and the\\nAusübung der Sitten-Lehre (Application of the\\nDoctrine of Morals) of 1696, as well as an influential excursion\\ninto metaphysics in the Versuch von Wesen des Geistes\\n(Essay on the Essence of Spirit) in 1699 (second edition\\n1709).\\n1.2 Philosophy',\n",
       " 'Thomasius is decidedly not a systematic philosopher; instead, and\\nquite consistent with his mature distaste for dogmatism in all its\\nforms, he is best characterized as a conscientiously eclectic thinker\\n(M. Albrecht 1994: 398–416; Bottin & Longo 2015:\\n301–315). That said, Thomasius’ thought is unified by an\\noverarching conviction in the priority of practical life, and the\\nbelief that erudition in whatever sphere of knowledge should be\\npursued for the sake of the improvement of our will and intellect for\\nuse in our ordinary life. This is made clear, for instance, in the\\ndefinition of learnedness (“Gelahrheit”) that\\nThomasius provides at the outset of his Introduction to the\\nDoctrine of Reason:\\n\\n\\nLearnedness is knowledge through which the human being is made capable\\nof properly distinguishing the true from the false and the good from\\nthe bad […] in order that one might promote one’s own\\ntemporal and lasting welfare, and that of others, in ordinary life and\\naffairs. (Thomasius 1691a: ch. 1, §1 [2019: 18])\\n\\n\\nSignificantly, and unlike subsequent Enlightenment thinkers, Thomasius\\nis also explicit in holding that because the attainment of learnedness\\nis possible wholly through the use of the natural (rather than the\\nsupernatural) light of the mind (cf. Thomasius 1691a: ch. 1,\\n§16), it is accessible by all, regardless of gender or class (for\\nmore on this, see\\n §6.1,\\n below).',\n",
       " 'In light of this, the aim of logic for Thomasius is to cultivate the\\npowers of the mind, and the faculty of reason in particular, so that\\nwe are capable of discerning what the natural light of the mind\\nreveals to be true or false in any field to which it is applied. This\\ninvolves not just supplying positive guidance with respect to how\\ntruth might be recognized and attained, but also negatively\\nidentifying and dispelling prejudices that obscure the natural light.\\nThomasius’ logic, therefore, is not primarily intended to offer\\na theory of demonstration (as with scholastic logics) nor an organon\\nfor specifically scientific discovery (as with Cartesian logics or,\\nlater, with Wolff’s logic). This distinctive aim does not,\\nhowever, prevent him from weighing in on matters of traditional\\nlogical and epistemological import; for instance, he contends that\\nthought has to do with images ultimately derived from the external\\nsenses (thereby rejecting innate ideas—Thomasius 1691a: ch. 3,\\n§22), and he outlines a theory of demonstration that focuses on\\npreserving conviction in truths through their connection to\\nincontrovertible first principles.',\n",
       " 'Thomasius’ Application of the Doctrine of Reason\\ncontributes to the project initiated in the Introduction by\\noutlining the means of avoiding error. Avoiding error involves the\\neradication of prejudices, which are among the causes of the\\ncorruption of reason and which are grouped into two main groups,\\nnamely, prejudices of authority and of precipitancy or hastiness.\\nThat, in turn, is accomplished through what he identifies as dogmatic\\ndoubt, not the Cartesian doubt that deems everything false so as to\\nfind a first indubitable principle, which is a pointless enterprise,\\naccording to Thomasius. Dogmatic doubt is the doubt about particular\\nthings, beliefs, and opinions, and this he found healthy and conducive\\nto preventing error.\\n\\nIn any case, the centrepiece of Thomasius’ logic, and probably\\nits most influential aspect, is his theory of truth. According to\\nThomasius’ definition, truth consists in\\n\\n\\nnothing other than an agreement between human thoughts and the\\nconstitution of things outside your thoughts. (Thomasius 1691a:\\nch. 5, §13 [2019: 28]; italics in original)\\n\\n\\nWhile this definition contains the classical correspondence\\ntheory of truth (in accordance with which truth consists in the\\ncorrespondence of our thoughts with things), Thomasius contends that\\nthe correspondence works in the other direction as well, namely, that\\ntruth also requires the correspondence of things with our powers of\\nthought:\\n\\n\\nHere, however, you should not ask whether the understanding must agree\\nwith things, or the things with the understanding; rather this harmony\\nis so constituted that neither provides the guiding principle for the\\nother, but this harmony is simultaneously presupposed by both even\\nthough external things as it were initiate it. (Thomasius 1691a: ch.\\n5, §14 [2019: 28])',\n",
       " 'In accordance with this conception of truth, Thomasius conceives of\\nthe mind as fundamentally active with its ideas (rather than merely\\npassively reflecting the order of nature) such that things must be in\\nagreement with its nature and capacities in order to be cognized or\\nwilled. Thomasius does not himself explore the principles that might\\ngovern the mind’s activity nor draw any idealistic consequences\\nfrom this conception of truth—that, for instance, things insofar\\nas they agree with our intellect might differ considered apart from\\nit—though his successors such as Adolph Friedrich Hoffmann and\\nChristian August Crusius would (on the latter, see\\n §5.2\\n below).\\n\\nThis conception of the human mind as fundamentally active is taken up\\nagain in Thomasius’ lone substantial contribution to\\nmetaphysics, the Essay on the Essence of Spirit, where\\nThomasius distinguishes spirit (Geist) from matter in virtue\\nof its activity. While this would appear to result in a metaphysical\\ndualism, Thomasius complicates things by endorsing a hierarchy of\\nspirits, not just between the human being and God, but also a class of\\nspirits responsible for various effects in bodies (such as heating and\\ncooling). Yet, his further postulation of an “air and light\\nspirit [ein Lufft- und Licht-Geist]” which fills the\\nspaces between parts of matter, not to mention his apparent\\nidentification of space itself as “pure spirit” (Thomasius\\n1709: 60, 167–8) muddles the original, starkly dualistic\\npicture.',\n",
       " 'Thomasius’s moral theory is a theory of the will. He held that\\nin moral matters, the will dominates reason. While human beings have\\nfree choice if not externally constrained, the will is not free;\\nrather, it is dominated by human affects—our passions, impulses,\\nand desires. Like Hobbes, Thomasius believed that even though subject\\nto such inner (psychological) constraints, the will still chooses\\n(with the aid of reason); it consciously wills. And a conscious choice\\nis precisely what is required for a (good) action to be considered\\nmoral: a good instinct or good inclinations may make us good, may even\\nbe desirable, but by itself this is not enough to make us moral.\\nMorality requires a conscious act of will. The trouble with morality\\narises because the will is determined by evil desires, in particular,\\nlust, ambition, and avarice. Although there are noble sentiments as\\nwell, which similarly influence the will, they are in conflict with\\nthe negative dispositions. The conflict can be brought to a positive\\nconclusion only by appeal to divine grace (God’s salvation), and\\nThomasius Application of the Doctrine of Morals is notable\\nfor its positive treatment of mystical experience.',\n",
       " 'Thomasius’ moral philosophy is accordingly informed by\\ntheological considerations in a way not shared by his works in\\ntheoretical philosophy. While, in the theoretical context, he did\\nbelieve in natural reason’s capacity to overcome corruption, in\\nthe practical context he held that an evil will is at the root of our\\ncorruption, and to ameliorate it we require God’s grace.\\nMoreover, Thomasius’s moral outlook seems to develop from his\\ninitial presentation of morality in the Introduction to the\\nDoctrine of Morals in 1692, which is an optimistic affirmation of\\nthe viability of a moral position he identified as one involving\\n“rational love” (vernünftige Liebe) as the\\nonly means to a “happy, courteous and cheerful life”, to a\\nmore pessimistic position in his Application in 1696 where he\\ncontends that human self-interest and an evil will constitute\\nsignificant obstacles to moral improvement (a development likely due\\nto his Pietist conversion during the period; cf. Beck 1969: 251;\\nAhnert 2006: 27–42).',\n",
       " 'This ambivalence and return to theology aside, Thomasius’s moral\\nposition is a distinctive one. The theory of rational love is based on\\nthe fundamental equality of human beings as well as on their ability\\nto think and choose independently (of authority). Ultimately,\\nThomasius’s ethics is a social ethics. The theory is\\nother-directed, and given the absence of laws and principles,\\nconstitutes a contrast to the formalist universalist ethics Kant would\\ndevelop by the end of the next century. At the same time, the lack of\\nany way of making this theory applicable in a context governed not by\\nsimilar but instead by conflicting interests, makes something like a\\nformalist ethics an inevitability. By the end of the Introduction\\nto Moral Theory, even Thomasius recognizes that “rational\\nlove” will function only in relatively harmonious contexts. In\\nother contexts, however, particularly those characterized by unequal\\npower positions, justice may well be required, a distinction in duties\\nwhich Thomasius influentially characterizes in terms of\\n“internal” and “external” obligation (cf.\\nBarnard 1988; Schneewind 1998: 165–166).\\n2. Radical Philosophy',\n",
       " 'Through the efforts of Thomasius, and later Christian Wolff, the\\nFriedrichs-Universität in Halle became the intellectual centre of\\nthe early Enlightenment in Germany. And despite, for instance,\\nThomasius’ conflict with Orthodox Lutheranism in Leipzig, and\\nWolff’s controversy with his Pietist colleagues\\n (§3.3,\\n below), neither were explicitly hostile towards religious belief, the\\nChurch, or to (appropriately exercised) religious authority; nor for\\nthat matter did either seek to challenge the existing political order.\\nBeyond the German academy, however, a more radical philosophical\\ntradition flourished, one that drew on the thought of, among others,\\nHobbes, Gassendi, and Spinoza, and proliferated through the\\ntransmission of clandestine literature within networks that spanned\\nacross Europe. While there was considerable diversity among the views\\nheld by the thinkers within this radical philosophical tradition, they\\ntended to be highly critical of organized religion (if not necessarily\\nprofessed atheists) and of the established political order, rejected\\nthe authority of the Bible as a source of revealed truth, and defended\\na (not always sophisticated) materialistic conception of the soul (cf.\\nStiehler 1966; Israel 2001: 628–636; Mulsow 2006 [2015]). It\\nbears noting that while this tradition flourished outside of a narrow\\nacademic context, there was nonetheless considerable exchange and\\nmutual influence between figures in both the mainstream and radical\\ntraditions.',\n",
       " 'Among the most important German thinkers within this radical\\nphilosophical tradition, and quite representative of its intellectual\\ndiversity, are Friedrich Wilhelm Stosch (1648–1704) and Theodor\\nLudwig Lau (1670–1740). Stosch was the son of a Reformed\\nminister and court chaplain in Brandenburg and worked as a court\\nsecretary until ill-health forced him to resign in 1686. Stosch\\nsubsequently pursued philosophical interests and in 1692 published his\\nsole known text, the Concordia rationis et fidei (Concord\\nof Reason and Faith). In spite of its title, the Concord\\nseeks to subordinate the claims of faith to the canons of reason, in\\naccordance with a broadly Socinian outlook, and Stosch denies that\\nthere is any basis in reason for conviction in the natural immortality\\nof the soul (for which he also provides a materialist account), and\\nrejects the reasonableness of eternal damnation. Stosch’s\\nConcord was published anonymously (with Amsterdam listed as\\nthe place of publication) with only 100 copies printed, but when these\\nwere discovered for sale, they were seized and burned. Stosch was\\nforced to identify himself as the author, was arrested, and\\nsubsequently investigated by a committee consisting of, among others,\\nPufendorf, concluding with Stosch’s public retraction of the\\nbook in 1694.',\n",
       " 'Lau had studied law in his home town of Königsberg before moving\\nto Halle in 1694 where he attended lectures by Thomasius. In 1695, he\\nembarked on a trip through Europe and England (where he apparently met\\nNewton), taking up a position as councillor with the young Duke of\\nCourland on his return. The early death of his patron saw Lau turn to\\nintellectual pursuits, and in 1717 he published a number of treatises\\non various subjects, including the anonymous Meditationes\\nphilosophicae de Deo, mundo et homine (Philosophical\\nMeditations concerning God, the World, and the Human Being). The\\ntext covers a wide range of philosophical (and medical and political)\\ntopics, and is distinctive in its eclectic borrowings from Spinoza,\\nLocke, Plotinus, and Giordano Bruno, among others. Its general\\nphilosophical outlook might most accurately be characterized as\\npantheistic, both in the Spinozistic sense inasmuch as Lau defends the\\nworld’s pre-existence in God and denies its creation ex\\nnihilo (although the extent of Lau’s Spinozism is disputed;\\ncf. Schröder 1987: 128–132), but also and especially in the\\nsense of the Irish freethinker John Toland’s pantheism inasmuch\\nas Lau attempts to outline the foundations of a universal religion.\\nDue to its strident denunciation of the clergy and a genealogical\\ncritique of the current political order, the Meditations was\\ninstantly controversial, and Lau’s publisher was eventually\\npressured into revealing Lau’s authorship. This led to\\nLau’s imprisonment, during which he attempted suicide, and his\\nsubsequent expulsion from Frankfurt am Main; Lau’s appeal to his',\n",
       " 'subsequent expulsion from Frankfurt am Main; Lau’s appeal to his\\nmentor, Thomasius, for a review of the proceedings was also met with a\\npainful denunciation. Lau attempted to return to his study of the law,\\nbut his unorthodox opinions and previous brush with infamy made this\\nimpossible (in spite of a formal recantation of his earlier views). He\\ndied, in poor mental health, in Altona in 1740.\\n3. The Controversy between Wolff and the Pietists',\n",
       " 'Thomasius would continue to exercise an important influence on German\\nphilosophy throughout the first half of the eighteenth century.\\nHowever, it was his colleague in the philosophy faculty at the\\nFriedrichs-Universität, Christian Wolff, who would contribute the\\nmost to the modernization of the German intellectual landscape and the\\nspread of the Enlightenment. Wolff achieved this primarily through his\\ndistinctive philosophical system, the so-called\\n“Leibnizian-Wolffian” philosophy, which incorporated the\\nlatest philosophical ideas and methods, including but not limited to\\nthose of Leibniz himself. The relevance and accessibility of\\nWolff’s system, expanded and refined by his many students,\\nquickly saw it gain a foothold in academies across Germany. Wolff was\\nnot without his detractors, of course, and none were more vocal, nor\\nmore successful (at least initially) in their efforts to limit his\\ninfluence, than his Pietist colleagues in the faculty of theology. The\\nfamous controversy between Wolff and the Pietists, which at its climax\\nsaw Wolff exiled from Prussia on pain of hanging in 1723, put the full\\nmenu of modern ideas—including materialism, idealism, atheism,\\nand Spinozism—before the literate public and drew the attention\\nof the rest of Europe to the German intellectual scene.\\n3.1 The “Leibnizian-Wolffian” Philosophy',\n",
       " 'Christian Wolff was born in Breslau (today, Wrocław) on 24\\nJanuary 1679. By all accounts a gifted student, he developed an\\ninterest in theology and mathematics during his time in Gymnasium, and\\nstudied theology and mathematics at the University of Jena and then in\\nLeipzig, gaining his Magister at Leizpig in 1702. His\\nsubsequent Habilitationsschrift on introducing mathematical\\nmethod to practical philosophy drew Leibniz’s attention to him.\\nThey began a correspondence that continued until Leibniz’s death\\nin 1716, and which covered topics from mathematics to metaphysics.\\nPartially through Leibniz’s support, Wolff was appointed to a\\nvacant chair in mathematics at the Friedrichs-Universität in\\nHalle, delivering his inaugural lecture in 1707.',\n",
       " 'Understandably, given the nature of his position, most of\\nWolff’s initial publications were devoted to mathematics and\\nnatural science, including an introduction to mathematics in 1710 and\\nan influential mathematical dictionary in 1716. Around 1710, however,\\nhe began to lecture on more narrowly philosophical topics, publishing\\nhis Vernünfftige Gedancken von den Kräfften des\\nmenschlichen Verstandes und ihrem richtigen Gebrauche in\\nErkäntnis der Wahrheit (Rational Thoughts on the Powers\\nof the Human Understanding and its Propert Use in the Cognition of\\nTruth) [the “German Logic”, hereafter GL] in\\n1713. Thus began Wolff’s famous series of German-language\\ntextbooks on philosophical topics, which would grow to include the\\nVernünftige Gedanken von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des\\nMenschen, auch allen Dingen überhaupt (Rational Thoughts\\non God, the World and the Soul of Man, and on All Things in\\nGeneral) [the “German Metaphysics”,\\nhereafter GM] in 1719 (albeit with a publication date of 1720), and\\nthe Vernünfftige Gedancken von der Menschen Thun und Lassen,\\nzu Beförderung ihrer Glückseligkeit (Rational\\nThoughts on Human Actions for the Promotion of their Happiness)\\n[the “German Ethics”, hereafter GE] in 1720,\\nfollowed by the “German Politics” in 1721, the\\n“German Physics” in 1723, and the\\n“German Teleology” in 1724.',\n",
       " 'This series of texts constitutes the first presentation of the\\nso-called “Leibnizian-Wolffian” philosophy that would come\\nto dominate the philosophical landscape in Germany. There is, of\\ncourse, no question that Wolff’s philosophical system is\\nthoroughly informed by Leibniz’s: Wolff himself admits that the\\nreading of Leibniz’s 1684 essay “Meditations on Cognition,\\nTruth, and Ideas”, and Leibniz’s classification of ideas\\nin particular, had sparked a “great light” that informed\\nhis German Logic (cf. GL “Vorrede”); moreover,\\nWolff himself reports that he incorporated a number of Leibnizian\\nconcepts into his presentation of ontology, cosmology, and rational\\npsychology in the German Metaphysics (cf. Wuttke 1841:\\n141–142). Even so, Wolff points out that when he started writing\\nhis series of philosophical textbooks there were few of\\nLeibniz’s texts available through which one might get a sense of\\nthe wider Leibnizian philosophy (Wuttke 1841: 140–141; cf. also\\nWilson 1994); thus he takes issue with the designation of his system\\nas “Leibnizian-Wolffian”—a coinage he credits to one\\nof his students, Georg Bernhard Bilfinger (Wuttke 1841: 142). The\\nextent of Leibniz’s influence on Wolff is widely debated (cf.\\nCorr 1975; École 1979), but it is in any case clear that\\nLeibniz is not the sole, nor in every case the most important,\\ninfluence on the development of Wolff’s ideas, as figures such',\n",
       " 'influence on the development of Wolff’s ideas, as figures such\\nas Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (1651–1708), John Locke,\\nand late Scholastic thinkers also exerted an important influence on\\nhis metaphysics, epistemology, and theory of science (Neveu 2018;\\nLeduc 2018; Dyck 2021a).',\n",
       " 'Turning to a brief overview of Wolff’s philosophical works, the\\nGerman Logic is intended, quite in contrast to\\nThomasius’, as a handbook for the acquisition, justification,\\nand orderly presentation of scientific cognition. So, in addition to\\nthe now expected treatment of concepts, propositions, and syllogisms,\\nWolff’s text contains discussion of drawing universal\\npropositions from individual experiences, of experiments, and of\\nscience and its distinction from faith and opinion. Moreover, the\\nGerman Logic contains Wolff’s mature presentation of\\nhis mathematical method, through which we proceed from definitions and\\naxioms to the formulation of theorems and postulates, and ultimately\\nto demonstrations, and it outlines how the method can be employed for\\nthe purpose of scientific discovery (for discussion, see Frketich\\n2019; Gava 2019). Significantly, it is this method that gains\\nwidespread application throughout Wolff’s philosophical\\nenterprise, including in his metaphysics.',\n",
       " 'The German Metaphysics was Wolff’s next major\\nphilosophical text, and in it he formally introduces the division of\\nmetaphysical topics into ontology, cosmology, empirical and rational\\npsychology and natural theology, a division that Kant, among others,\\nwould subsequently take up. The initial chapter attempts to make\\nevident, in a Cartesian vein, both an indubitable truth (“we are\\ncertain that we exist”) and to establish a canon for what will\\ncount as a certain cognition for the remainder of the\\nenterprise. In the second chapter Wolff sets out the two (Leibnizian)\\nprinciples governing his philosophical thought: the principle of\\ncontradiction (“something cannot both be and not be at the same\\ntime” GM §10) and the principle of sufficient reason.\\nSignificantly, Wolff suggests that while the first is self-evident,\\nthe second admits of proof, for which Wolff (in a departure from\\nLeibniz) offers two arguments. The first proceeds as follows:\\n\\n\\nWere it the case that something could be, or take place, in a thing\\nwithout a reason why it should occur being met with either in that\\nthing itself or something else, then it would come to be from nothing.\\nSince, however, it is impossible that something could come to be from\\nnothing, everything that is must have a sufficient reason why it\\nis. (GM §30 [2019: 101])\\n\\n\\nIn the remainder of the ontology, Wolff provides accounts of concepts\\nthat will be key for his subsequent treatment of specific metaphysical\\ntopics, including essence and attribute, space and time, simple and\\ncomposite, substance, power, and cause.',\n",
       " 'The chapters on empirical and rational psychology outline an account\\nof the soul in general and of the human soul in particular. In his\\nempirical treatment, Wolff considers what can be known of the soul by\\nmeans of our ordinary inner experience. He contends that we can\\ndistinguish thoughts in terms of obscurity, clarity, and distinctness,\\nbut we can also distinguish the soul’s representations in terms\\nof their content. Accordingly, they can be classified into sensations,\\nimaginings, and thoughts proper, which can in turn be traced back to\\nvarious faculties of the soul, including sensibility, imagination, and\\nthe understanding, in virtue of which it is capable of these distinct\\nthoughts. We also discern that the soul is subject to pleasure and\\ndispleasure in its (distinct or indistinct) cognition of good and\\nevil, which give rise to desires and willing (based on indistinct and\\ndistinct cognition respectively), and when that willing is in\\naccordance with what pleases the soul the most then, for Wolff, its\\nacts are free (GM §519).',\n",
       " 'On the basis of these empirical cognitions of the soul, rational\\npsychology seeks to draw inferences regarding the soul’s essence\\nand nature. Wolff argues that the soul must be immaterial given that\\nit is impossible that a body should think (GM §738), and as a\\nresult that the soul is a simple substance endowed with a power of\\nwhich its thoughts are effects, which power is identified as a power\\nof representation (GM §§742–7). This secures the\\nsoul’s natural immortality, or incorruptibility, but Wolff\\nargues for the soul’s personal immortality, or its preservation\\nof its state of conscious representation and memory in the afterlife\\n(GM §§925–6). It is in the context of rational\\npsychology that Wolff also offers a defence of the Leibnizian doctrine\\nof pre-established harmony (§765), which he think accounts for\\nthe empirically-observed agreement between the states of the soul and\\nthe body better than the competing systems of physical influence and\\noccasional causation.',\n",
       " 'The final pair of topics concern the world (cosmology) and God\\n(natural theology). Regarding the former, Wolff identifies the world\\nas the “series of changeable things that are next to one another\\nand follow one upon the other” (GM §544 [2019: 120]). As\\nsuch, the world is a composite consisting of ultimately simple\\nsubstances, though Wolff declines to identify them as Leibnizian\\nmonads as he hesitates to ascribe representational states to the\\nconstituents (“elements”) of matter (GM\\n§§598–9). Things and events in the world are\\nnonetheless connected to one another in accordance with the principle\\nof sufficient reason, and Wolff concludes that all events are certain\\nas a result (GM §561). Concerning God, Wolff argues that He must\\nexist inasmuch as our own evident existence requires a necessary being\\nto serve as its sufficient reason, which necessary being must also be\\nindependent, eternal, and simple (GM §§928–936); it\\ncannot, therefore, be the world (a composite) nor our own soul (a\\nbeing dependant on the world), and so can only be God (GM §945).\\nIn addition to these attributes, God must have an understanding,\\nthrough which He distinctly represents all that is possible, and a\\nfree will inasmuch as He chooses that world which pleases Him most to\\nmake actual (GM §980).',\n",
       " 'Rounding out Wolff’s major philosophical works of this period,\\nthe German Ethics is composed of four parts, a theoretical\\npart that treats the foundation of practical philosophy and three\\npractical parts that present a doctrine of duties that human beings\\nhave towards themselves, God, and others. The central notion in\\nWolff’s ethics is the (metaphysical) notion of perfection which\\nconcerns the “agreement” of elements in a given manifold\\n(cf. GM §152), and which is cognized through our intellectual\\npowers. It is the cognition of the (apparent) perfection in an action\\nthat moves us to act, a fact that accounts for Wolff’s emphasis\\non the duty to cultivate our understanding among our duties to\\nourselves so that we can be moved to act in (what are in fact) the\\nmost perfect ways. Promoting the perfection of ourselves and others\\nserves for Wolff as the universal rule in accordance with which we\\nought to choose between two (or more) possible actions (GE §12).\\nThat is to say, when making a free choice we ought to consider whether\\nthe action “promotes the perfection of our inner and outer\\nstate” (GE §2) and that means considering whether the state\\nof the soul and the body accords with the prior state or contradicts\\nit. The outcome has greater perfection to the extent that it\\ncontributes to the continued “natural human state and its\\nharmonious preservation over time”(GE §2). The natural\\nhuman state Wolff envisions is the state of the soul in its manifold\\nefforts to find truth, and everything has to be done to maximize that\\nstate. It so happens, that this is where happiness lies as well, and\\nas Wolff indicates at the end of the ethics, it is incumbent upon\\nhuman beings to ensure not only their own perfection/happiness, but to',\n",
       " 'human beings to ensure not only their own perfection/happiness, but to\\n“contribute as much as possible to the happiness of\\nothers” (GE §767).\\n3.2 The Halle Pietists',\n",
       " 'Next to Thomasius and Wolff, the most important intellectual figure in\\nthe early history of the Friedrichs-Universität in Halle was\\nAugust Hermann Francke (1663–1723). As we have seen, Francke had\\ncourted controversy in Leipzig through his involvement in the Pietist\\nmovement. Pietism was a spiritual movement within the Lutheran\\ntradition that rejected the scholastic and theological turn that\\nLutheranism had taken and proposed a further, internal reformation to\\nsupplement the already-effected external one, and aimed at cultivating\\na “living faith” rather than mere lip-service to Christian\\nideals. The Pietists sought the personal and interior experience of a\\nrelationship to Christ, an individual transformation that was the\\nresult of an act of divine grace modelled on Francke’s own\\nconversion experience (cf. Wallmann 1990: 63–4). To this end,\\nthe Pietists focused on the study of the Bible itself and devotional\\nliterature in small groups—the so-called conventicles or\\ncollegia pietatis—which were notable, and\\ncontroversial, for welcoming the involvement of women (R. Albrecht\\n2004; Gierl 2015).',\n",
       " 'After falling out (in spite of Thomasius’ support) with the\\nLutheran authorities in Leipzig, Francke followed Thomasius to Halle.\\nHe took up a position as a pastor in the neighbouring town of Glaucha,\\nand held lectures on oriental languages in 1692. Francke was himself a\\ndisciple of the movement’s intellectual founder, Philipp Jakob\\nSpener (1635–1705), though Francke contributed immeasurably to\\nthe spread of Pietism, primarily through his educational institutions\\nin Halle, beginning with a school for poor children founded in 1695.\\nThrough the institutions that arose from this humble school, Francke\\nsought a reform of educational principles in line with Pietist ideals,\\nand in this was enormously successful. The pedagogical institutions\\nsupplied an influential model for similar institutions in and outside\\nof Germany (especially due to the fact that it was a largely\\nself-funded philanthropic institution), became the hub of an expansive\\nmissionary network, and trained the next generation of German\\ntheologians, as well as some philosophers (like A. G. Baumgarten), not\\nto mention Prussian civil administrators, bureaucrats, and pastors.\\nIndeed, Francke enjoyed a close relationship to the Prussian court,\\nand king Friedrich I’s successor, Friedrich Wilhelm I became an\\nenthusiastic supporter of his projects after a visit to Halle (cf.\\nHinrichs 1971).',\n",
       " 'Another significant member of the theology faculty in Halle was\\nJoachim Lange (1670–1744). Lange had come under Francke’s\\ntutelage in Leipzig (where he also met Thomasius), following him to\\nErfurt and (briefly) Halle, before taking up positions at various\\nGymnasia in and around Berlin. During this time he also lectured on\\nclassical languages and wrote a very successful Latin grammar. In\\n1709, he accepted an appointment at the Friedrichs-Universität,\\nin the theology faculty that was now thoroughly steeped in\\nFrancke’s Pietism. During his time in Berlin, Lange completed a\\nnotable philosophical work, the Medicina mentis (Medicine\\nof the Mind), printed in Halle in 1704. Lange’s text shares\\na title with Tschirnhaus’ Medicina mentis of 1687, but\\nlittle else as Lange instead emphasizes the futility and vanity of\\nhuman attempts to attain cognition through their own efforts,\\nhighlighting the mind’s proneness to error and prejudice in its\\nfallen state. Rather, according to Lange, it is only by means of\\ndivine grace and the divine light that we can heal the corrupted\\nintellect and the will (Schönfeld 2010).',\n",
       " 'A final figure worthy of mention in this context, albeit not\\nstrictly-speaking a Pietist thinker, is Johann Franz Budde\\n(1667–1729). Budde had studied theology in Wittenberg, and after\\nlecturing at Jena, had been called to an appointment in moral\\nphilosophy at Halle in 1693, where he remained until returning to Jena\\nin 1705 as a professor of theology. Budde adopted a conscientiously\\neclectic philosophical outlook, one influenced by Thomasius, and which\\nalso informed his theological commitments to Lutheranism (if not to\\nPietism specifically). A prolific writer, he published a number of\\nphilosophical works during his time in Halle, including the\\nInstitutiones philosophiae eclecticae that appeared in two\\nparts in 1703. The two parts are the “Elementa philosophiae\\ntheoreticae”, roughly a metaphysics, and the “Elementa\\nphilosophiae instrumentalis”, Budde’s logic. A later work,\\nentitled Theses theologicae de atheismo et superstitione\\n(1717), is also notable in that Budde seeks to refute various threats\\nto natural and revealed religion, including Spinozism (cf. Rumore\\n2019: 44–8), an issue that would come to the fore in the coming\\ncontroversy with Wolff.\\n3.3 The Controversy and its Aftermath',\n",
       " 'The controversy between Wolff and his Pietist colleagues is not\\ntypically held to be of much philosophical significance. Rather, the\\nPietists’ hostility towards Wolff is taken to be a reflection of\\ntheir fundamentally un-enlightened anti-intellectualism, and the\\noutbreak of the controversy itself a result of personal and\\nprofessional rivalries—competition for students and university\\nchairs. That this appraisal is generally accepted is to no small\\nextent due to the efforts of subsequent histories of the dispute\\nwritten by devoted Wolffians, such as C. G. Ludovici (1707–78)\\nand Georg Volckmar Hartmann (fl. 1729–1737). And while it cannot\\nbe denied that the voluminous texts exchanged during the course of the\\ncontroversy, on both sides, only infrequently rise above the level of\\nthe polemical, it would be unfair to dismiss the ground of the\\nPietists’ objections as philosophically insignificant, or indeed\\nirrelevant for the subsequent development of German philosophy (up to\\nand including Kant).',\n",
       " 'The controversy itself was the result of long-simmering tensions\\nbetween Wolff and the Pietists. Wolff’s turn to lecturing on\\nphilosophical topics, such as metaphysics (including a treatment of\\nnatural theology), beginning in 1710, not to mention his discussion in\\nthe German Logic of Scriptural interpretation, provoked the\\nire of the theology faculty and led to warnings to their students\\nabout attending Wolff’s lectures (on account of his\\n“Atheisterey”; cf. Beutel 2007: 165–6). The\\npublication of Wolff’s German Metaphysics in 1719, with\\nits peculiar proof of God’s existence and apparent endorsement\\nof natural necessitation, provided a broad target for their critical\\nattention. This largely behind-the-scenes friction broke into the open\\nwith Wolff’s address on 12 July 1721, on the occasion of the\\ntransition of the pro-rectorship from himself to Lange, in which he\\ndefended the consistency of Confucian (i.e., non-Christian) practical\\nphilosophy with Enlightened reason (and Wolffian moral philosophy in\\nparticular; cf. M. Albrecht 1985).',\n",
       " 'The address caused an uproar among the Pietists and Francke demanded\\nto see a copy of Wolff’s address to scrutinize for himself,\\nwhich request Wolff denied citing the independence of the philosophy\\nfaculty. Lange at this point took up the study of Wolff’s\\nmetaphysics, penning a damning appraisal for the theology faculty that\\nwas sent to the authorities in Berlin. Wolff was invited to reply, and\\nhis rejection of the hostile characterization of his views led to the\\nformation of an official commission in late October 1723 to\\ninvestigate the charges against Wolff. The king himself would soon\\nintervene, and decisively: after the dangers of Wolffian philosophy\\nwere explained to two of his generals visiting Halle—the\\ndoctrine of the pre-established harmony in particular was said to\\njustify the desertion of soldiers (Beutel 2001: 189)—and this\\nthreat conveyed to the king, Friedrich Wilhelm I asked his trusted\\nadvisor Francke to outline the problematic doctrines defended by\\nWolff, which he promptly did. Horrified by Wolff’s evident\\ngodlessness, the king dismissed Wolff from his position and ordered\\nhim to leave Prussia in 48 hours on pain of hanging, an order that was\\nreceived in Halle on 12 November 1723. Wolff reacted swiftly, crossing\\nover to nearby Electoral Saxony, refunding his students’ fees,\\nand ultimately took up the offer of a position in Marburg where he\\nreceived an enthusiastic reception.',\n",
       " 'Wolff’s expulsion only meant that the dispute moved into the\\npublic domain, and the next decade would see dozens of treatises\\nexchanged between Wolff (and his defenders) and his opponents, Lange\\nand Budde foremost among them. A range of issues were canvassed in the\\ndebate. So, the issue of the libertas philosophandi had\\nalready surfaced in the conflict between the philosophical and\\ntheological faculties, and there were significant differences between\\nWolff and the Pietists concerning the ground of moral obligation\\n(Grote 2017); however, the principal topics were metaphysical. These\\ninclude the pre-established harmony, which Lange rejected as\\ninconsistent with any proper union between soul and body, defending\\ninstead a natural connection between them achieved through physical\\ninflux (Lange 1724: 48–50 [2019: 141–2]).',\n",
       " 'Even so, the Pietists’ foremost philosophical concern was with\\npreserving the genuine freedom of the human (and divine) will against\\nWolff’s Leibniz-inspired assaults (cf. Bianco 1989). According\\nto Lange, Wolff’s endorsement of the principle of sufficient\\nreason has the consequence of reducing the soul to an automaton and\\nrendering the series of events that constitute the world a fatally\\ndetermined concatenation. The result is a necessitarianism\\ndistinguishable from total Spinozism only because Wolff accepts a\\nplurality of substances (Lange 1724: 72–3 [2019: 153]). Against\\nthis, Lange contends that the freedom (rather than mere spontaneity)\\nof the will is directly evident through experience (particularly\\nthrough our conscience) and constitutes the essence of the human\\nbeing, that it is required for morality and religion, and that it\\nserves to exempt human beings from the chain of natural necessitation.\\nIn spite of his unsympathetic reception in the history of philosophy,\\nLange succeeds in outlining a coherent antithesis to the\\nLeibnizian-Wolffian conception of the soul and its place in nature,\\none that would prove influential for later Pietist critics (like\\nCrusius) and that would also form an important part of the background\\nto Kant’s own later discussion of freedom.',\n",
       " 'After their initial success with Wolff’s expulsion, Lange and\\nthe Pietists suffered diminished influence at the Prussian court. By\\ncontrast, the affair only served to burnish Wolff’s European\\nreputation. In Prussia, Wolff’s works on metaphysics and\\npractical philosophy were added to the list of atheist books, but he\\nnow saw himself as speaking to Europeans, not merely Germans, and\\nbegan a series of Latin works, commencing with the Philosophia\\nrationalis sive logica (Latin Logic) in 1728. Friedrich\\nWilhelm I seemed to think better of his precipitous decision and\\ninvited Wolff to return to Prussia in 1733, an invitation which Wolff\\ndeclined. But the ban on his writings was reversed in 1734, and the\\nverdict of an inter-confessional Prussian commission in 1737\\nvindicated Wolff’s philosophy of the charges levelled by the\\nPietists. The crown prince (later Friedrich II) was an enthusiastic\\nbooster of Wolff at the court (and no friend of the Pietists), and\\nwith his ascension in 1740 he invited Wolff to return to Prussia.\\nAfter turning down the proffered presidency of the Berlin Academy,\\nWolff returned to a professor- and vice-chancellorship in Halle to\\ngreat acclaim, devoting his remaining time to completing his works on\\npractical philosophy.\\n4. Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten',\n",
       " 'A. G. Baumgarten is best known for authoring the textbook in\\nmetaphysics that Kant used for his lectures on the topic, though he\\nwas an important and innovative thinker in his own right. His\\nphilosophical ambitions are, moreover, deeply informed by the\\ncontroversy in Halle, as he had an abiding intellectual sympathy with\\nWolffianism but theological and personal connections to the Pietists.\\nAmong his students was the notable Wolffian philosopher Georg\\nFriedrich Meier (1717–77), and his own influence extended to\\nKant but also to Moses Mendelssohn and J. G. Herder.\\n4.1 Life and Works',\n",
       " 'Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten was born in Berlin on 17 June 1714.\\nBaumgarten’s mother died when he was three, and his father, a\\ngarrison chaplain and pastor, died when he was eight in 1722, leaving\\nhim to the care of his grandmother and older brothers. In accordance\\nwith his father’s wishes, Baumgarten went to Halle to study,\\nenrolling in the Latin school at Francke’s Waisenhaus\\nwhere his older brother Siegmund Jakob (1706–57), who would\\nhimself become a famous theologian, was an inspector. Baumgarten\\nthrived in his studies, and in 1730 matriculated at the university,\\nwhere he attended lectures by Francke and Lange in theology. While it\\nwas still forbidden to teach Wolff’s philosophy, Baumgarten\\nundertook (with his brother’s encouragement) a thorough study of\\nWolff’s thought, lecturing on his logic in the Latin school and\\nvisiting Wolffians at the university in Jena. Baumgarten turned to the\\nstudy of philosophy, attaining his Magister in 1735, and held\\nlectures on logic and Wolffian metaphysics, dictating from his own\\nnotes on the latter (rather than a textbook) from which notes his own\\nlater Metaphysica derives. In 1736, a chronic lung ailment\\ninterrupted his academic work and saw him hospitalized in Berlin,\\nreturning to Halle in 1737 where he continued to lecture to great\\nacclaim. His position at Halle had been as an (unpaid) extraordinary\\nprofessor, but in 1739 he was called to a position at the university\\nat Frankfurt an der Oder, and he left Halle in 1740 just before',\n",
       " 'at Frankfurt an der Oder, and he left Halle in 1740 just before\\nWolff’s triumphant return. In Frankfurt, Baumgarten lectured\\nwidely in philosophy, including on aesthetics for the first time in\\n1742. Health problems, likely tuberculosis, and other difficulties,\\nmarked the last decade of Baumgarten’s life, and he died on 26\\nMay 1762.',\n",
       " 'Baumgarten’s philosophical works cover a wide range of topics.\\nThe 1000 sections of his Metaphysica of 1739 offers a\\nsynopsis of his views, following the Wolffian division, on ontology,\\ncosmology, empirical and rational psychology, and natural theology. He\\nalso published two influential textbooks on ethics: the Ethica\\nphilosophica (Philosophical Ethics) of 1740 and\\nInitia philosophiae practicae primae (Elements of First\\nPractical Philosophy), both of which Kant also regularly used in\\nhis lectures on moral philosophy. Baumgarten’s abiding interest\\nin aesthetics issued in two texts, the first a dissertation entitled\\nMeditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema\\npertinentibus (Reflections on Poetry) in 1735, and the\\nsecond the ambitious Aesthetica, the first volume of which\\nappeared in 1750, with a second unfinished volume printed (at the\\nrequest of the publisher) in 1758.\\n4.2 Philosophy',\n",
       " 'Baumgarten’s metaphysics is frequently characterized as\\ninclining more towards Leibniz than to the\\n“Leibnizian-Wolffian” philosophy; for instance, he makes\\nexplicit reference to monads in his presentation of ontology and\\ncosmology, and concerning the pre-established harmony he accepts that\\nit obtains between all substances (not just between soul and body) and\\ndoes not qualify his endorsement of the system as Wolff came to do\\n(Baumgarten 1739: §761–9; cf. Watkins 2005: 73–81 for\\ndiscussion). While there is no doubt that Baumgarten adopts a\\nfundamentally Leibnizian picture in his ontology, including the\\nendorsement of the principle of sufficient reason, to leave it at this\\nwould be to ignore the important and fruitful role that his Pietist\\nbackground plays in his philosophical thought (Look 2018). Indeed,\\nBaumgarten’s originality as a thinker consists in his efforts to\\namend key planks of Leibnizian (and Wolffian) thinking in light of his\\nunderlying Pietist commitments.',\n",
       " 'This is particularly evident in Baumgarten’s treatment of\\nfreedom and immortality, where Wolff’s position on each was\\ntargeted by his Pietist critics. By way of addressing the Pietist\\nobjections to Wolff’s moral intellectualism and his reduction of\\nfreedom to mere spontaneity, Baumgarten offers an enriched empirical\\npsychology, one that considers the influence of expectations of the\\nfuture (and a future life) as motives, that allows that immoral action\\ncan proceed not only from ignorance but also from less lively\\ncognition of the good, and that explicitly distinguishes spontaneity\\nfrom freedom proper (Schwaiger 2011: 82–92). On the topic of\\nimmortality, the Pietists had likewise objected to Wolff’s\\nemphasis on the human soul’s preservation of its\\ncognitive capacities in the afterlife, which state seems for\\nWolff to be disconnected to the human’s cultivation of virtue\\nand piety in this life. Baumgarten seeks to rectify this by arguing\\nthat in addition to preserving its cognitive capacities in the\\nafterlife, the soul will also retain its moral capacities including\\nfreedom, and that its condition of blessedness or damnation in the\\nlife to come will be a direct function of its moral condition (1739:\\n§§782, 791; Dyck 2018).',\n",
       " 'Consistent with his orientation in metaphysics, Baumgarten is an\\noriginal moral philosopher within the Wolffian tradition. He is\\nnotable, for instance, for the centrality of the notion of obligation\\nin his ethics. Wolff had framed a novel concept of obligation, rooted\\nin the nature of things and actions themselves rather than the will of\\na sovereign, in accordance with which an obligation arises simply\\ninsofar as some motive is naturally connected to an action (GE\\n§9). Yet, whereas Wolff only treats obligation briefly before\\nconsidering specific duties, in Baumgarten’s hands the problem\\nof obligation becomes the unifying theme for ethics, particularly in\\nhis Initia (Schwaiger 2009). Moreover, while Baumgarten\\naccepts Wolff’s ethical perfectionism, in contrast with Wolff he\\ndownplays the connection between perfection and happiness, perhaps in\\nresponse to Pietist denunciations of Wolff’s perfectionism as a\\nveiled form of hedonism (Schwaiger 2011: 163ff; Bacin 2015). A last\\ninnovation is Baumgarten’s consideration of the ways in which\\nethical systems themselves can be flawed in that, for instance, they\\nmake a virtuous condition too easily attainable (flattering ethics) or\\nset the bar for virtue too high for human nature (chimerical ethics)\\n(Thorndike 2008; Dyck 2012).',\n",
       " 'Turning finally to Baumgarten’s aesthetics, it is notable that\\nwhile Wolff himself had comparatively little to say about the\\nphilosophy of art (but see Beiser 2009; and Buchenau 2013), a number\\nof thinkers in the Wolffian interest took a keen interest in the\\ntopic. The first to develop a theory of the arts, particularly poetry,\\nwas Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700–1766), who published his\\nVersuch einer critischen Dichtkunst vor die Deutschen\\n(Attempt at a Critical Poetry for the Germans) in 1730.\\nTreating poetry scientifically, he set out a set of rules that were to\\nguide the composition. Given his conception of what a poem was (a\\nmoral fable) and given as well his idea of what was involved in its\\ncomposition (a set of rules), there was little room here for beauty\\nand even less for sentiment and inspiration.',\n",
       " 'It was left to Baumgarten to formulate a recognizably modern aesthetic\\ndoctrine on Wolffian foundations. This he did through focusing on the\\nsoul’s faculty of sensibility, ultimately identifying aesthetics\\nas the science of sensible cognition. Where Wolff had conceived of the\\nsenses merely as providing the raw material for thinking, Baumgarten\\nthought that the senses had their own rules and their own perfection,\\nrules and perfection that differ from logical rules and the knowledge\\ngenerated by the process of intellectual clarification. So, while\\nrepresentations might be logically perfect and attain to intensive\\nclarity insofar as we distinguish a number of marks within it,\\nrepresentations of the senses, even as confused representations, can\\nattain to extensive clarity inasmuch as they represent a\\nmultitude of things (Baumgarten 1735: §17). In this way, poetic\\nrepresentation can be richer, and more moving, than representations\\nattained through the use of the understanding—moving since\\nBaumgarten contends that such representations as (aesthetically)\\nperfect can also occasion pleasure in us. One cannot but see the\\ninfluence that Baumgarten likely had on Kant’s Critical\\nphilosophy — his vindication of the senses reappears in an\\ninherently Kantian way both in the Transcendental Aesthetic of the\\nCritique of Pure Reason and in the Critique of the Power\\nof Judgment.\\n5. Christian August Crusius',\n",
       " 'As Baumgarten sought in a conciliatory spirit to make the Wolffian\\nphilosophy responsive to Pietist concerns, Christian August Crusius\\nmounted a renewed, Pietist-inspired but philosophically-sophisticated\\nassault on the foundations of that system. Through his dissertations\\nand textbooks, Crusius succeeded in raising trenchant objections to\\nthe Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy, and indeed to the strongest forms\\nof philosophical rationalism, and he formulated an influential and\\nsystematic alternative in which the will and its freedom are central\\nconcerns.\\n5.1 Life and Works',\n",
       " 'Christian August Crusius was born 10 June 1715 in Leuna, near Halle,\\nthe son of a pastor (and his mother was a pastor’s daughter). He\\nmatriculated at the University of Leipzig in 1734, where he studied a\\nnumber of subjects but was particularly interested in theology and\\nphilosophy. At Leipzig, Crusius came under the influence of the\\nphilosopher (and physician) Adolf Friedrich Hoffmann\\n(1707–1741), a disciple of Andreas Rüdiger\\n(1673–1731) who had been a close associate of Thomasius. Crusius\\nattained the Magister in philosophy in 1737 and habilitated\\nin philosophy in 1740. He followed his philosophical studies with a\\nbaccalaureat in theology in 1742, though he would proceed to seek a\\nposition in the philosophy faculty. To this end, he defended two\\ndissertations in philosophy, one of which, the Dissertatio\\nphilosophica de usu et limitibus principii rationis determinantis,\\nvulgo sufficientis (Philosophical Dissertation on the Use and\\nLimits of the Principle of Determining Reason, commonly called\\nSufficient) of 1743 was a critical discussion of the principle of\\nsufficient reason. He became a professor of philosophy\\n(extraordinarius) at Leipzig in 1744.',\n",
       " 'Crusius’ major philosophical works followed in quick succession.\\nHe published his textbook on ethics, the Anweisung vernünftig\\nzu Leben (Guide to Rational Living) in 1744; this was\\nfollowed by the elaboration of his metaphysics, Entwurf der\\nnothwendigen Vernunft-Wahrheiten (Sketch of the Necessary\\nTruths of Reason) in 1745; and a text in logic, the Weg zur\\nGewißheit und Zuverläßigkeit der menschlichen\\nErkenntiß (Path to the Certainty and Reliability of\\nHuman Cognition) was published in 1747 (a final philosophical\\ntreatise on physics followed in 1749). As an ordinary professorship in\\nphilosophy was not available, Crusius joined the theology faculty at\\nLeipzig in 1750. While he remained a member of the philosophy faculty\\nand continued his lectures (and revised his previous publications for\\nlater editions), from this point on his original publications are\\ndevoted to theological topics. He died in Leipzig on 18 October\\n1775.\\n5.2 Philosophy',\n",
       " 'Widely and rightly regarded as the most sophisticated philosopher\\nwithin the Thomasian-Pietist tradition, Crusius sets out to offer an\\nalternative to the core claims of the Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy\\non topics in metaphysics, epistemology, logic and practical\\nphilosophy. As Lange had previously, Crusius targets the principle of\\nsufficient reason, and its employment in Leibnizian-Wolffian\\nmetaphysics, for criticism. Crusius diagnoses a number of ambiguities\\nin the Wolffian presentation of the principle. He opts to refer to a\\nreason (ratio; Grund) that, when present, determines\\nsomething to come to be such that the opposite would be impossible as\\na determining reason, and accordingly refers to the principle\\n(in the sense intended by Leibniz and Wolff) as the principle of\\ndetermining reason (Crusius 1743: §II–III). Crusius\\nthen critically discusses each of Wolff’s attempts to prove the\\nprinciple—concerning the first such proof (presented in\\n §3.1,\\n above), Crusius claims that the most charitable reconstruction of it\\nis circular. To show this, Crusius reformulates Wolff’s proof as\\nthe following syllogism (using Wolff’s preferred\\nterminology):\\n\\n\\nWhatever cannot come to be except from some other cause, has a\\nsufficient reason.\\n\\nEverything that is cannot come to be except from another cause.\\n\\nTherefore, whatever is has a sufficient reason. (Crusius 1743:\\n§XI [2019: 207])\\n\\n\\nAs Crusius notes, however, the minor in this case is just a version of\\nthe principle of sufficient reason itself, so that as a proof of that\\nprinciple this argument begs the question.',\n",
       " 'More positively, Crusius endorses the principle of determining reason\\nbut denies that it admits of unlimited use, which he claims, echoing\\nLange, would entail fatalism. Rather, Crusius excludes what he terms\\n“free first [or fundamental] actions” from the\\nscope of the principle. These actions are such that they proceed\\ndirectly from the basic powers of the acting substance under\\nappropriate circumstances (Crusius 1745: §82), but are such that\\nthey can be undertaken or omitted by the acting subject (that is, they\\nare not determined) (Crusius 1743: §XXV). That such\\nactions are possible, Crusius claims, is clear given that God’s\\naction would be of this sort, but also given the testimony of our own\\ninner experience, which discloses the acts of our own will to be just\\nsuch actions (Crusius 1743: §IX). Crusius thus accepts that the\\nprinciple of determining reason holds for all events that are\\nnot the result of a free first action, whereas free first\\nactions no doubt have a cause but are not such that could not have\\noccurred otherwise (or not at all).',\n",
       " 'Along with his efforts to secure a place for genuine freedom of the\\nwill in his metaphysics, Crusius also emphasizes the limits of the\\nhuman understanding. Crusius claims that the acts of the understanding\\nare governed by principles, including a formal principle (the\\nprinciple of contradiction), but also and importantly a number of\\n“material” principles that govern what is thinkable for\\nthe human mind (where what is unthinkable is not for that reason\\ncontradictory). Among these principles are the principle of\\ninseparability, according to which that which cannot be separated\\nin thought cannot be separated in fact, and the priniciple of\\nincombinability, according to which that which cannot be combined\\nin thought cannot in fact be combined (Crusius 1743: §XXVII;\\n1745: §15). Significantly, and drawing on Thomasius (via Hoffmann\\n1737), Crusius contends that these principles which together\\nconstitute the “essence of the understanding” supply us\\nwith a criterion of truth, which consists in the agreement of thoughts\\nwith things, such that only that can be true which conforms to the\\nprinciples of human understanding (Crusius 1745: §15; 1747:\\n§51). These material principles are subsequently used by Crusius\\nto vindicate a variety of substantive metaphysical claims, including\\none he dubs the principle of sufficient cause (Crusius 1745:\\n§31). On this basis, Crusius erects his own distinctive\\nmetaphysics, proceeding through the now-established Wolffian topics,\\nthough Crusius assigns natural theology a place more befitting its\\nimportance and ignores empirical psychology because it takes up\\nspontaneous and free acts of the mind and so does not concern\\nnecessary truths of reason, the only proper subject of\\nmetaphysics.',\n",
       " 'Crusius’ attack on Wolffianism continues in his logic and his\\nthoughts on moral philosophy. In a clear rebuke of Wolff, Crusius\\nbegins his logic by rigidly distinguishing between the methods of\\nmathematics and philosophy, contending that where the former makes use\\nof demonstrations that rely solely on the principle of contradiction\\n(and relate to mere possibilities or hypothetical realities), the\\nlatter must take into account other principles when, for instance, the\\ninvestigation of causes are at issue (Crusius 1747: §10).\\nCommensurate with this, Crusius’ considerations of the\\ntraditional topics of logic—concepts, propositions, and\\ninferences—is thoroughly informed by his account of the essence\\nof the understanding: a philosophical inference, as opposed to a\\nmathematical syllogism, can have as its basis what permits of being\\nseparated or combined in thought (Crusius 1747: §262). Crusius\\nalso considers the relation between philosophy and theology or\\nrevealed religion, contending for the utility of philosophy for\\nstudents of theology but also arguing that religion provides a needed\\ncorrective to the misuse of philosophy which, when left to its own\\ndevices, tends to lay claim to the unrestricted use of its principles\\n(such as PSR) whereas the appropriate restrictions are typically\\nevident to the theologian (Crusius 1747: §32).',\n",
       " 'Crusius’ ethics is characterized by the principled separation of\\nthe will from the understanding as distinct powers, and a\\nre-orientation of his moral theory with respect to the former. The\\nhuman will depends on the understanding to supply it with ideas in\\naccordance with which it acts, but Crusius is clear that the will is\\nnot solely determined to its action through some cognition (i.e., of\\nperfection) in the act itself; rather, the goodness of an action\\nconsists more generally in its being conformable to the will (Crusius\\n1745: §26; Schneewind 1998: 447), and in any case the human will\\nis always free to act or to omit to act in accordance with the\\nunderstanding’s ideas. The human will is possessed of three\\nbasic desires—the first is for our own perfection, in accordance\\nwith which the talents of the intellect among others are promoted\\n(Crusius 1745: §117); for unification with objects perceived as\\nperfect, from which proceeds a drive to moral love through which we\\ndesire to join with other rational beings without any further end\\n(Crusius 1745: §125); and finally, the desire to recognize a\\ndivine law which, despite its abstract-sounding name, is identified by\\nCrusius with the phenomenon of conscience (Gewissenstrieb).\\nIt is through conscience that we are able to recognize the divinely\\ngiven moral law (Crusius 1745: §132), and conscience thereby also\\ndiscloses our dependence on God as divine lawgiver (Crusius 1745:\\n§165). As such, conscience supplies us with a motivation to\\nobedience where, according to Crusius, this obedience constitutes an\\nessential component (the “form”) of virtue (Crusius 1745:',\n",
       " 'essential component (the “form”) of virtue (Crusius 1745:\\n§177). A derivation of our duties thus depends on a consideration\\nof God and His aim in creating the world, which Crusius identifies as\\nall human beings’ attainment of virtue, as opposed to\\nknowledge or happiness in its own right, through their free actions\\n(Crusius 1745: §213). On this basis, he proceeds to derive duties\\nto God, to others, and to the self (for discussion, see Schneewind\\n1998: 452–6).\\n6. Women and Other Under-Represented Thinkers',\n",
       " '(Note: Treatment of these figures has not been integrated into the\\nforegoing solely for the convenience of those interested primarily in\\ntheir contributions.)\\n\\nA variety of circumstances—religious, political, and\\nsocial—conspired to give women limited opportunities to engage\\nin and with the contemporary intellectual culture, even compared to\\ntheir French- and English-speaking contemporaries. The German-speaking\\nlands of Europe lacked a major cosmopolitan centre, like London or\\nParis, to germinate progressive ideas and to propagate those developed\\nabroad. Moreover, the fact that, in spite of Thomasius’ and\\nWolff’s efforts, German intellectuals continued to publish (and\\nteach) in Latin through the first half of the eighteenth century,\\nmeant that women’s access to these ideas remained limited. There\\nwere a handful of notable attempts by reformers (including Francke) to\\nredress the general oversight of girls’ education, but by and\\nlarge their education was a private matter and in any case guided by\\nthe traditional conception of women’s threefold\\nBestimmung as Gattin, Mutter, and\\nHausfrau (wife, mother, and housewife).',\n",
       " 'Despite these substantial obstacles, however, women did engage with\\nthe figures and debates of the time, and indeed they contributed in\\nvarious and integral ways to the history of German philosophy\\nthroughout the eighteenth century. Similar to the British and French\\ncontexts, women in Germany exerted an important influence on\\nintellectual culture directly through the publication of conventional\\ntreatises, but also indirectly through their correspondence with\\nwell-known philosophers, through provoking and mediating intellectual\\ndisputes, and (particularly in the second half of the eighteenth\\ncentury) through hosting salons that attracted leading philosophers\\nand scientists, among others. And, likewise comparable to the British\\nand French contexts (cf. O’Neill 1997), these contributions have\\nbeen widely overlooked in subsequent histories of German philosophy,\\nboth for familiar reasons having to do both with the narrowness of the\\nconception of the philosophical canon (Shapiro 2016), but also due to\\nthe concerted efforts among nineteenth-century German academics to\\nexclude women from the academy (Ebbersmeyer 2020).\\n6.1 Women and the Thomasian Philosophy\\n\\nWomen played crucial roles in the conception, refinement, and\\npopularization of the key ideas and systems of the German\\nEnlightenment, as can be seen by considering their contributions to\\nand connections with the two major early philosophical schools of the\\nperiod already discussed: the Leibnizian-Wolffian and the\\nThomasian(-Pietist). With respect to Thomasius, it should be noted\\nthat he makes quite clear himself that his intention in publishing his\\nworks in logic and ethics in the vernacular was to reach a wider\\naudience, including women. Thus, the subtitle of his Introduction\\nto the Doctrine of Reason indicates that it will show',\n",
       " 'in an intelligible manner [how] to distinguish the true, probable, and\\nfalse from one another and to discover new truths, all without\\nsyllogistics, for all reasonable people of whatever estate or gender\\nthey might be.\\n\\n\\nAmong those women impacted by Thomasius’ logic is Dorothea\\nChristiane Erxleben (née Leporin, 1715–62), who\\nwould later receive the first doctorate in medicine in Germany from\\nthe university in Halle in 1753. In 1742 she published a treatise\\nentitled Gründliche Untersuchung der Ursachen, die das\\nweibliche Geschlecht vom Studiren abhalten (Rigorous\\nInvestigation of the Causes that Obstruct the Female Sex from\\nStudy). While Erxleben there draws on a variety of sources,\\nincluding Wolffian thought (cf. Stiening 2020), she makes good use of\\ntwo aspects of Thomasius’ logic, namely, his\\npractically-oriented account of learnedness, and the doctrine\\nof prejudice presented in the concluding chapter (cf. Dyck 2021c). So,\\nin the Rigorous Investigation, Erxleben defines learnedness\\n(“Gelehrsamkeit”) as\\n\\n\\na grounded knowledge of such necessary and useful truths whereby\\nthe understanding and will, and consequently true human happiness, are\\nimproved. (Erxleben 1742: §21 [2019: 44]; italics in\\noriginal)\\n\\n\\nProceeding from this, she contends that it is important that and\\nentirely possible for women to be able to attain such learnedness for\\nsake of the concerns of ordinary life.',\n",
       " 'Further, Erxleben identifies the widespread conviction that the\\nattainment of learnedness is unsuitable for women as the result of\\nprejudice, of which Erxleben distinguishes four principal types: that\\nwomen are unsuited (in virtue of their natural capacities) to attain\\nlearnedness; that its attainment could not be useful for them; that\\nlearnedness could only be misused by women; and that women would only\\nseek to attain learnedness to distinguish themselves from their peers.\\nBy way of rebutting these prejudices, Erxleben draws on an array of\\nsources, including theological, philosophical, and medical\\nauthorities, and argues generally that whatever disparities might\\ncurrently obtain between the apparent talents and achievements on the\\npart of each sex are not the result of a difference in natural\\ncapacities but instead only evidence of the salutary effect of\\neducation on the human being (cf. Erxleben 1742: §71).\\n6.2 Women and the Leibnizian-Wolffian Philosophy',\n",
       " 'With respect to the Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy, there is\\nsignificant evidence of women’s extensive engagement with the\\nsystem already at its origins. Leibniz exchanged letters with a number\\nof women, but his correspondence with his patroness Electress Sophie\\nof Hanover (1630–1714), who happened to be the sister of\\nElisabeth of Bohemia, and her daughter Queen Sophie Charlotte of\\nPrussia (1668–1705), is particularly significant as it\\nfrequently turned to philosophical topics. In his letters, and his\\npersonal exchanges with “the two Sophies”, Leibniz can be\\nseen to refine and develop key doctrines, including his conception of\\nsubstance and his attempted theodicy (Strickland 2011: 35–48),\\nwhere Leibniz himself claimed that his Theodicée found\\nits beginnings in his conversations with Sophie Charlotte. Sophie of\\nHanover likewise supplied Leibniz with one of his favourite pieces of\\nempirical evidence for the principle of the identity of indiscernables\\n(when she challenged a courtier to find two identical leaves during a\\ngarden stroll). Sophie of Hanover was no dogmatic Leibnizian however,\\nas she maintained her commitment to physical influence between the\\nmind and the body, and hosted controversial figures such as Francis\\nMercury Van Helmont (1614–1699) and John Toland\\n(1670–1722) at her court. It is, however, debated whether Sophie\\nshared the materialist views of these thinkers when it comes to the\\nmind (de Careil 1876; Strickland 2009 and 2011: 49–64) or\\ninstead upheld a metaphysically agnostic view regarding the nature of\\nthe soul (Leduc 2021).',\n",
       " 'As for the other founder of the Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy, Wolff\\ndoes not seem to have been similarly influenced by interaction with\\nwomen in the development of his system. Through adopting the\\nvernacular for his initial series of textbooks, however, he did at\\nleast indirectly contribute to making the latest innovations in\\nmetaphysics, ethics, politics, and physics accessible to a wider\\nliterate audience including women. Indeed, this hardly seems to have\\nbeen an undesired consequence as, at one point, at the urging of the\\nSaxon nobleman and Wolffian devotée Ernst Christoph Graf von\\nManteuffel (1676–1749), Wolff drafted the beginning of an\\nintroduction to Wolffian philosophy intended specifically for women\\n(cf. Ostertag 1910). In the 1740s and 1750s in particular, Wolffian\\nphilosophy had gained such a following among women of society that one\\ncommentator quipped that it was as if “an actual\\nlycanthropy” had broken out (Edelmann 1740: 108). Among those\\nwomen so influenced was Émilie du Châtelet\\n(1706–49), who made use of foundational Wolffian metaphysical\\nprinciples in her presentation of Newton’s physics in her\\nInstitutions de physique—Wolff and du Châtelet\\nengaged in correspondence for a time, and he commended her mastery of\\nhis system to others and appraised her as a more talented philosopher\\nthan her companion Voltaire.',\n",
       " 'In addition to du Châtelet, a number of women took up the task\\nof defending and developing Leibnizian-Wolffian ideas. None were more\\nactive in this than Luise Adelgunde Viktorie Gottsched\\n(née Kulmus, 1713–62), whose husband Johann\\nChristoph\\n (§4.2\\n above) was a Wolffian disciple who made contributions to philosophy\\n(metaphysics and aesthetics), as well as to literary theory and the\\ndevelopment of German letters. In virtue of her ambitious education\\n(especially in languages), Luise Gottsched contributed extensively to\\nJohann Christoph’s efforts to promote German letters and\\ntheatre, and was a prolific translator, both in the context of her\\nhusband’s ambitious projects and in her own right. Thus, she\\nmade substantial contributions to Johann Christoph’s\\ntranslations of Leibniz’s Theodicée (J. C.\\nGottsched 1744) and of Bayle’s Dictionaire historique et\\ncritique (1741–44) (for other philosophical translations,\\nsee Brown 2012). She also translated Réflexions nouvelles\\nsur les femmes (1727; L. A. V. Gottsched 1731) by the Parisian\\nsalonnière Anne-Thésèse, Marquise de\\nLambert and produced a translation of and an original response to\\nMadeleine Angélique Poisson de Gomez’s Le triomphe de\\nl’éloquence (1730; L. A. V. Gottsched 1739), which\\nemphasized the importance of education (including philosophy) for\\nwoman’s cultivation of virtue.',\n",
       " 'Another notable figure in this respect is Johanna Charlotte Unzer\\n(née Ziegler, 1725–82), who was raised in an\\nintellectual family in Halle: her uncle J. G. Krüger\\n(1715–59) was a well-known Wolffian scientist, and\\nBaumgarten’s student G. F. Meier was a close family friend.\\nUnzer herself would become a renowned poet, though she produced a\\nhighly original philosophical contribution to Wolffian thought in her\\nGrundriß einer Weltweisheit für das Frauenzimmer\\n(Outline of a Philosophy for the Lady) of 1751. In that text,\\nUnzer seeks to present the doctrines of Leibnizian-Wolffian logic and\\nmetaphysics in an aesthetically perfect manner, often making use of\\npoetry to provide a moving illustration of an otherwise abstruse\\ntheorem. In the process, Unzer grants German women access to the most\\nchallenging and controversial philosophical debates of her time\\n(including Wolff’s account of scientific reasoning, the\\nchallenge of materialism, and the Leibnizian doctrine of monads) with\\nthe express intention of equipping her female readers to engage in\\nspeculative and scientific investigations themselves. At the same\\ntime, she offers a dynamic revision and re-orientation of the Wolffian\\nphilosophy which, significantly, attempts to carve out a space for the\\n(as yet unfounded) discipline of aesthetics (Buchenau 2021).\\n6.3 Anton Wilhelm Amo',\n",
       " 'A final figure worthy of mention in this context is Anton Wilhelm Amo,\\nthe first African-born professor of philosophy in Germany. Amo was\\nborn in Axim in present-day Ghana around 1700, but was brought to the\\nNetherlands as a small boy in 1707 through the Dutch West India\\nCompany. Shortly after, he was given to the young Anton Ulrich, Duke\\nof Wolfenbüttel-Braunschweig, and baptized on 29 July 1708. Amo\\nevidently worked as a servant in the Duke’s court in\\nWolffenbüttel, though he would also receive an education which\\nprepared him sufficiently for study at the Friedrichs-Universität\\nin Halle, where he matriculated on 9 June 1727. There, Amo studied\\nphilosophy and law, and it is reported that he presented a (now lost)\\ndisputation in November 1729 entitled De jure maurorum in\\nEuropa (On the Rights of Moors in Europe), in which he\\ncontended (according to a contemporary account) against the legality\\nof slavery in the Holy Roman Empire given that the privileges granted\\nto African kings by the (old) Roman Emperor meant that they were\\nvassals of the Empire, and entitled to consideration under the\\nlaw.',\n",
       " 'Amo matriculated at the university in nearby Wittenberg the following\\nyear, and was promptly awarded a Magister in philosophy.\\nWhile in Wittenberg, Amo wrote a dissertation, entitled De humanae\\nmentis apatheia (On the Impassivity of the Human Mind)\\nin 1734, which qualified him to teach, and later in the same year he\\nsupervised a dissertation which he is also thought to have had a hand\\n(at least) in writing (Menn & Smith 2020: 68–71). Amo would\\nreturn to teach philosophy at Halle, and in 1738 published a\\nwide-ranging manual for his philosophical lectures, Tractatus de\\narte sobrie et accurate philosophandi (Treatise on the Art of\\nPhilosophizing Soberly and Accurately). Not long after, however,\\nAmo applied for a position at the University of Jena, claiming\\nindigence, and was granted permission to lecture there in 1740. For\\nreasons that we can only speculate about, Amo would request passage on\\na ship to return to Africa in 1746 (Menn & Smith 2020: 38), and it\\nwas in Axim that a Swiss doctor would report encountering Amo in the\\nearly 1750s. Amo is thought to have died not long after.',\n",
       " 'In his principal philosophical work, the dissertation on\\nImpassivity, he argues against the claim that the soul can be\\nendowed with a passive faculty of sensation, a position he identifies\\nas stemming from Descartes (Amo 1734a: 13–14 [2020: 179]). Amo\\nunderstands the human mind to be a species of spirit, which is purely\\nactive and immaterial. Were the mind to be endowed with a capacity to\\nsense, it would have to be able to receive ideas, and in one of three\\nways: by “communication” (i.e., in the manner that fire\\n“communicates” its heat to an object), by penetration\\n(i.e., through interposition of another entity), or by direct contact\\n(Amo 1734a: 5 [2020: 161]). Amo argues that it is impossible to\\nconceive of the mind receiving ideas in any of these ways as it would\\nviolate its essence as a spontaneous being and its immaterial nature\\nprecludes transmission through contact (for discussion, see Walsh\\n2019). Perplexingly, in spite of contending for the soul’s\\nimpassivity, Amo endorses the Aristotelian dictum that “nothing\\nis in the intellect that was not first in the senses” (Amo\\n1734b: 6). Amo also affirms the mind’s capacity to influence the\\nbody (Amo 1734a: 8 [2020: 169]), though without accounting for how he\\ntakes this to be possible or explicitly engaging with the debate\\nrelating to the pre-established harmony. Nonetheless, in his lifetime\\nAmo was identified by at least one influential historian as a Wolffian\\nthinker (Ludovici 1738: §202).',\n",

They think that after it has left the body it no\\nlonger exists anywhere, but that it is destroyed and dissolved on the\\nday the man dies.” This view is restated by Simmias (at 77b) as\\nthe opinion of the majority (cf. 80d); note that the view includes the\\nidea that the soul is a material thing, and is destroyed by being\\ndispersed, “like breath or smoke” (70a).

It seems likely,\\nhowever, that Alcmaeon distinguished between human beings as\\nindividual bodies, which do perish, and as souls, which do not (Barnes\\n1982, 115). There is no evidence about what Alcmaeon thought happened\\nto the soul, when the body perished, however. Did he believe in\\nreincarnation as the Pythagoreans did? No ancient source associates\\nAlcmaeon with reincarnation and his sharp distinction between animals\\nand human beings may suggest that he did not believe in it (Guthrie\\n1962: 354). He might have thought that the soul joined other divine\\nbeings in the heavens. The point of Fragment 2 may be that, whereas\\nthe heavenly bodies do join their beginnings to their ends in circular\\nmotion, humans are not able to join their end in old age to their\\nbeginning in childhood, i.e. human life does not have a cyclical\\nstructure. We might even suppose that the soul tries to impose such a\\nstructure on the body from its own circular motion but ultimately\\nfails (Guthrie 1962, 353).

Survival and its Alternatives\\n\\nIn ancient Western philosophy, Plato affirmed both a pre-natal life of\\nthe soul and the soul’s continued life after the death of the\\nbody. In Plato’s Phaedo, Socrates presents reasons why\\na philosopher should even welcome death (albeit not permitting or\\nencouraging suicide), because of its emancipation of the souls of\\nthose who are good in this life to a great afterlife. In the work of\\nEpictetus, on the other hand, death is conceived of as a\\nperson’s ceasing to be. Epictetus does not argue that we should\\nwelcome death but he holds that we should not fear death because we\\nwill not exist after death. The philosophical assessment of the truth\\nof such matters continues on to the present, as does debate on the\\nimplications of whether we may survive death. Why?\\n\\nThere are many reasons why there should be ongoing attention as to\\nwhether Plato or Epictetus—or any other philosopher who offers a\\ndifferent account about the reality or illusion of an\\nafterlife—is right. One reason is that the values we have in the\\nhere and now have a bearing on what we may or should hope for in terms\\nof the future. While some philosophers believe that what happens in\\nthe future has enormous consequences for life’s meaning now,\\nother philosophers have so focused on the importance of the present\\nthat questions about the future of humanity in this life, and the\\npossible good or ill of an afterlife for individuals, is of little\\nimportance.

But do we know\\nthat an individual afterlife is impossible? Later in this entry, we\\nsuggest that ruling out an afterlife as impossible is philosophically\\ntenuous.

Kant suggests six links between the aesthetic and moral,\\nwhich together make palpable the satisfaction of the four conditions\\nof the possibility of morality that were noted in the introduction to\\nthe present section.\\n\\n\\nFirst, Kant evidently holds that objects of aesthetic experience can\\npresent morally significant ideas to us without sacrificing what is\\nessential to them as objects of aesthetic response and judgment.  This\\nis obvious in the theory of aesthetic ideas, where Kant indeed assumes\\nthat works of art always have some morally relevant content. But this\\nview takes other forms as well. In fact, Kant maintains that all forms\\nof beauty, natural as well as artistic, can be regarded as expressions\\nof aesthetic ideas: even natural objects can suggest moral ideas to us\\nalthough such suggestion is not the product of any intentional human\\nactivity (CPJ, §51, 5:319). In “The Ideal of\\nBeauty,” Kant also maintains that beauty in the human figure can\\nbe taken as “the visible expression of moral ideas, which\\ninwardly govern human beings”; here he argues that only human\\nbeauty can be taken as a unique standard for beauty, because it is the\\nonly form of beauty that can express something absolutely and\\nunconditionally valuable, namely the moral autonomy of which humans\\nalone are capable. At the same time he holds there is no determinate\\nway in which this unique value can be expressed in the human form,\\nthus there is always something free in the outward expression in the\\nhuman figure of the inner moral value of the human character\\n(CPJ, §17, 5:235–6).', metadata={'article_id': '24', 'authors': ['Paul Guyer --- paul_guyer@brown.edu'], 'chunk': 176.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=aesthetics-18th-german', 'date': '2020', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/aesthetics-18th-german/', 'title': '18th Century German Aesthetics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='This is not a return to those thinkers (Augustine De Musica,\\nAquinas Summa Theologica) who thought that aesthetic\\nexperience was a direct apprehension of some inherent property of an\\nobject, like its being well-formed for its function, or symmetrical in\\na way that reflects the divine. According to Kant, beauty isn’t\\nstrictly speaking a property of objects (even though we speak as\\nthough it is), and we aren’t even tempted to attribute sublimity\\nitself to objects. The focus here is pleasure in the powers of\\nuniversal mental capacities themselves. Part of Kant’s\\ninnovation in aesthetics consists in the suggestion that objects might\\ndeserve certain subjective responses.\\n\\nThis idea is not easy to understand, and many have done significant\\ninterpretive and substantive philosophical work attempting to explain\\nhow an object could deserve a subjective feeling (see e.g. Mothersill\\n1988; Eaton 2001; Hamawaki 2006; Moran 2012; Cavell 1965 [2007];\\nGinsborg 2015; Gorodeisky 2019, 2021). One approach here is to\\ninterpret the pleasure in question as not just a phenomenal tone (see\\nLabukt 2012, Bramble 2013) but rather as a kind of liking or\\npro-attitude which, like other attitudes, could be suited or\\n‘fitted’ to its intentional object (Gorodeisky 2019, 2021;\\nKriegel forthcoming; compare Hume 1757 [1987a]).', metadata={'article_id': '19', 'authors': ['Antonia Peacocke --- peacocke@stanford.edu'], 'chunk': 17.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=aesthetic-experience', 'date': '2023', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/aesthetic-experience/', 'title': 'Aesthetic Experience'})]"

It is a pleasure in perceiving the form of an object without conceptualizing its function, and it involves a feeling of pleasure that everyone ought to take in the object. Kant's analysis of fine art suggests that successful works of fine art are products of genius, which must leave room for the freedom of the imagination and cannot present ideas directly and didactically. The beauty of the human figure is associated with morally good ideas, and the ideal of beauty is a species of adherent rather than free beauty.\\n\",\n",

       " Document(page_content='Immanuel Kant’s immensely influential Critique of\\nJudgment (1789 [1987]) peeled aesthetic experience away from\\napprehension of the divine, and cleaved the apprehension of form away\\nfrom function. He claimed you make a pure judgment of\\n(“free”) beauty when you take pleasure just in perceiving\\nthe form of an object without even conceptualizing its function.\\n\\nKant clearly contradicts his German predecessors in his claim that\\n“neither does perfection gain by beauty, nor beauty by\\nperfection” (§16 at p. 78). Nonetheless, Kant does make two\\nkinds of theoretical concessions to this tradition. First, he allows\\nthat his German predecessors like Baumgarten may have confused\\nperfection for a purpose with a subjective kind of purposiveness\\nwithout reference to any specific purpose. This latter\\n“purposiveness” is difficult to understand, but Kant\\nsuggests that it consists in the harmony of an object’s parts,\\nas presented in experience, that allows you to unite them in your\\nimagination into a structured unity (§15, p. 74; see Section\\n2.3). Secondly, Kant concedes that we sometimes speak of\\n“beauty,” e.g. the beauty of a building, when we highlight\\nhow something is perfect for its function. Kant calls this\\n“accessory beauty” (or “adherent beauty,”\\nanother translation of “pulchritude adhaerens”)\\n(§16 at p. 76).\\n\\nKant is often cited as a “formalist”—someone who\\nclaims that aesthetic experience focuses exclusively on formal\\nproperties of objects—but this is a matter of interpretive\\ndispute.

       " Document(page_content='In this account, Kant makes two striking assumptions. First, he\\nasserts that in “pure” judgments of taste our pleasure in\\nbeauty is a response only to the perceptible form of an\\nobject, not to any matter or content it may have—for example, in\\npictorial arts, “the drawing is what is\\nessential,” while the “colors that illuminate the\\noutline…can…enliven the object in itself for sensation,\\nbut cannot make it…beautiful” (CPJ, §14,\\n5:225). Second, he assumes that the cognitive faculties of all human\\nbeings work the same way, that is, respond to particular objects in\\nthe same way, even when they are in “free play” rather\\nthan at serious work. The second of these claims seems indefensible,\\nbut Kant never backs off from it. The first of these claims also seems\\nunjustifiable, but this time Kant modifies his claim almost as soon as\\nhe makes it. While he continues to maintain that in pure judgments of\\ntaste our pleasure is in the unity of the form of the object alone, he\\nquickly recognizes that there are a variety of impure forms\\nof beauty where what we respond to with the free play of our\\nimagination and understanding is harmony between an object’s\\nperceptible form and its matter, its content, or even its\\npurpose. Thus, just two sections after his assertion of formalism,\\nKant introduces the category of “adherent beauty,” which\\nis the kind of harmony between an object’s form and its intended\\nfunction that pleases us in a beautiful summer-house or racehorse; and\\nhe will subsequently assume that successful works of fine art normally\\nhave intellectual content and please us in virtue of the harmony among\\ntheir content, form, and material.', metadata={'article_id': '24', 'authors': ['Paul Guyer --- paul_guyer@brown.edu'], 'chunk': 171.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=aesthetics-18th-german', 'date': '2020', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/aesthetics-18th-german/', 'title': '18th Century German Aesthetics'}),\n",

Kant then argues that there are\\ntwo elements in such an ideal, namely a uniquely valuable purpose or\\nend and a uniquely appropriate aesthetic expression of this purpose\\nor end. “The human being alone is capable of an ideal\\nof beauty,” Kant then argues, because “the\\nhumanity in his person, as intelligence, is alone among all the\\nobjects in the world capable of the ideal\\nof perfection” (ibid., 5:233).  That is, according to\\n(practical) reason the human being is the only thing of unconditional\\nvalue.

This\\nis obvious in the theory of aesthetic ideas, where Kant indeed assumes\\nthat works of art always have some morally relevant content. But this\\nview takes other forms as well. In fact, Kant maintains that all forms\\nof beauty, natural as well as artistic, can be regarded as expressions\\nof aesthetic ideas: even natural objects can suggest moral ideas to us\\nalthough such suggestion is not the product of any intentional human\\nactivity (CPJ, §51, 5:319). In “The Ideal of\\nBeauty,” Kant also maintains that beauty in the human figure can\\nbe taken as “the visible expression of moral ideas, which\\ninwardly govern human beings”; here he argues that only human\\nbeauty can be taken as a unique standard for beauty, because it is the\\nonly form of beauty that can express something absolutely and\\nunconditionally valuable, namely the moral autonomy of which humans\\nalone are capable. At the same time he holds there is no determinate\\nway in which this unique value can be expressed in the human form,\\nthus there is always something free in the outward expression in the\\nhuman figure of the inner moral value of the human character\\n(CPJ, §17, 5:235–6).', metadata={'article_id': '24', 'authors': ['Paul Guyer --- paul_guyer@brown.edu'], 'chunk': 176.0, 'citation': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=aesthetics-18th-german', 'date': '2020', 'source': 'https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2024/entries/aesthetics-18th-german/', 'title': '18th Century German Aesthetics'}),\n",

According to Kant, beauty isn’t\\nstrictly speaking a property of objects (even though we speak as\\nthough it is), and we aren’t even tempted to attribute sublimity\\nitself to objects.

Nonetheless, Kant does make two\\nkinds of theoretical concessions to this tradition. First, he allows\\nthat his German predecessors like Baumgarten may have confused\\nperfection for a purpose with a subjective kind of purposiveness\\nwithout reference to any specific purpose. This latter\\n“purposiveness” is difficult to understand, but Kant\\nsuggests that it consists in the harmony of an object’s parts,\\nas presented in experience, that allows you to unite them in your\\nimagination into a structured unity (§15, p. 74; see Section\\n2.3). Secondly, Kant concedes that we sometimes speak of\\n“beauty,” e.g. the beauty of a building, when we highlight\\nhow something is perfect for its function. Kant calls this\\n“accessory beauty” (or “adherent beauty,”\\nanother translation of “pulchritude adhaerens”)\\n(§16 at p. 76).\\n\\nKant is often cited as a “formalist”—someone who\\nclaims that aesthetic experience focuses exclusively on formal\\nproperties of objects—but this is a matter of interpretive\\ndispute.

       "[Document(page_content='1. Survival and its Alternatives\\n\\nIn ancient Western philosophy, Plato affirmed both a pre-natal life of\\nthe soul and the soul’s continued life after the death of the\\nbody. In Plato’s Phaedo, Socrates presents reasons why\\na philosopher should even welcome death (albeit not permitting or\\nencouraging suicide), because of its emancipation of the souls of\\nthose who are good in this life to a great afterlife. In the work of\\nEpictetus, on the other hand, death is conceived of as a\\nperson’s ceasing to be. Epictetus does not argue that we should\\nwelcome death but he holds that we should not fear death because we\\nwill not exist after death. The philosophical assessment of the truth\\nof such matters continues on to the present, as does debate on the\\nimplications of whether we may survive death. Why?\\n\\nThere are many reasons why there should be ongoing attention as to\\nwhether Plato or Epictetus—or any other philosopher who offers a\\ndifferent account about the reality or illusion of an\\nafterlife—is right. One reason is that the values we have in the\\nhere and now have a bearing on what we may or should hope for in terms\\nof the future. While some philosophers believe that what happens in\\nthe future has enormous consequences for life’s meaning now,\\nother philosophers have so focused on the importance of the present\\nthat questions about the future of humanity in this life, and the\\npossible good or ill of an afterlife for individuals, is of little\\nimportance.

A number of Stoic\\narguments for the claim that the soul is a body have come down to us\\n(see Annas 1992, 39-41). The best one of these is that the soul is a\\nbody because (roughly) only bodies affect one another, and soul and\\nbody do affect one another, for instance in cases of bodily damage and\\nemotion. Epicurus employs the same argument in his Letter to\\nHerodotus, which provides an outline of his physical doctrines\\n(Long & Sedley 1987 [in what follows L&S] 14A7). In a way that\\nreminds one of Presocratic theories, both Epicurus and the Stoics hold\\nthat the soul is a particularly fine kind of body, diffused all the\\nway through the perceptible (flesh-and-blood) body of the animate\\norganism. As if echoing the view of the soul that Simmias in the\\nPhaedo presents as the majority view, Epicurus thinks that the\\nsoul is dispersed at death along with its constituent atoms, losing\\nthe powers that it has while it is contained by the body of the\\norganism that it ensouls (L&S 14A6). The Stoics agree that the\\nhuman soul is mortal, but they also take it that it can and does\\nsurvive the person's death — that is, its separation from the\\nperceptible body.

On the other hand, it is what at the time of death departs from\\nthe person's limbs and travels to the underworld, where it has a more\\nor less pitiful afterlife as a shade or image of the deceased\\nperson.

In Plato’s Phaedo, Socrates presents reasons why\\na philosopher should even welcome death (albeit not permitting or\\nencouraging suicide), because of its emancipation of the souls of\\nthose who are good in this life to a great afterlife. In the work of\\nEpictetus, on the other hand, death is conceived of as a\\nperson’s ceasing to be. Epictetus does not argue that we should\\nwelcome death but he holds that we should not fear death because we\\nwill not exist after death. The philosophical assessment of the truth\\nof such matters continues on to the present, as does debate on the\\nimplications of whether we may survive death. Why?\\n\\nThere are many reasons why there should be ongoing attention as to\\nwhether Plato or Epictetus—or any other philosopher who offers a\\ndifferent account about the reality or illusion of an\\nafterlife—is right. One reason is that the values we have in the\\nhere and now have a bearing on what we may or should hope for in terms\\nof the future. While some philosophers believe that what happens in\\nthe future has enormous consequences for life’s meaning now,\\nother philosophers have so focused on the importance of the present\\nthat questions about the future of humanity in this life, and the\\npossible good or ill of an afterlife for individuals, is of little\\nimportance.

      "page_content='1. Survival and its Alternatives\\n\\nIn ancient Western philosophy, Plato affirmed both a pre-natal life of\\nthe soul and the soul’s continued life after the death of the\\nbody. In Plato’s Phaedo, Socrates presents reasons why\\na philosopher should even welcome death (albeit not permitting or\\nencouraging suicide), because of its emancipation of the souls of\\nthose who are good in this life to a great afterlife. In the work of\\nEpictetus, on the other hand, death is conceived of as a\\nperson’s ceasing to be. Epictetus does not argue that we should\\nwelcome death but he holds that we should not fear death because we\\nwill not exist after death. The philosophical assessment of the truth\\nof such matters continues on to the present, as does debate on the\\nimplications of whether we may survive death. Why?\\n\\nThere are many reasons why there should be ongoing attention as to\\nwhether Plato or Epictetus—or any other philosopher who offers a\\ndifferent account about the reality or illusion of an\\nafterlife—is right. One reason is that the values we have in the\\nhere and now have a bearing on what we may or should hope for in terms\\nof the future. While some philosophers believe that what happens in\\nthe future has enormous consequences for life’s meaning now,\\nother philosophers have so focused on the importance of the present\\nthat questions about the future of humanity in this life, and the\\npossible good or ill of an afterlife for individuals, is of little\\nimportance.

Answering both\\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\\ntime of death.
