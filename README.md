# DeepAnalytic
This repository is dedicated to my research project on utilizing LLMs for various use cases in the context of Analytic Philosophy.
A large amount of specialized philosophical data has been scraped from leading academic journals. Various cutting-edge NLP tasks will be performed on the collected
data, for purposes of research.

## Data
- The metadata of 28 Springer Nature philosophical journals have been scraped. This records the metadata of around 800k pages of philosophical texts.
- The codes to scrape the metadata, as well as the text data from the papers, will be uploaded here.
- The scraped dataframes will become available through a data-sharing platform in the near future.
- The text data of other philosophical journals, from other publishers such as Oxford University Press, is also scraped. In particular, over 10k pages of papers from
  the leading journal *Analysis*, alongside their metadata, are scraped. The relevant codes will be shared and the datasets will be uploaded after preprocessing the
  proprietary data before making it available to the public.

## Analysis and Modeling
- Aside from the basic EDA and NLP analyses, various cutting-edge NLP tasks are scheduled to be performed on the scraped data in the near future. These tasks include:
- Fine-tuning a sentence transformer on the specialized text data to create domain-specific vectorization, which will be used for topic modeling
  and semantic search purposes.
- Creating philosophy-specific Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets for benchmarking.
- Question answering on philosophical text data
